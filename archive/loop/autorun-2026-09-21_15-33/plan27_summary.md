# plan27 summary — #99 follow-up research (planner-direct, DONE)

Session: ses_f1d198b41ffeJA3a3By7tu3TfD, planner-27,
Qwen3.8-27B-Q3S-245K-slow, looprun autorun-2026-09-21_15-33 (iter 27,
unit-4 restart branch after planner-26 `action: restart`).

## What was done

The #99 follow-up research (his ruling 2026-09-27: "if there is a way to set
keeptoken flexibly, it should be used") was completed PLANNER-DIRECT — the
plan26 close left the findings ~80 % in hand (installed source tree located,
`preserve_recent_tokens` found at compaction.ts L117); the remaining checks
were bounded greps + one provenance webfetch. A serial delegation
round-trip was not worth the slot.

## Findings (all file-located, in the research doc)

1. **Installed host = 1.18.32** (measured: npm platform package
   `opencode-windows-x64` version) — the host-map's "1.18.31" reading
   (2026-09-21) is stale. The scratchpad tree
   `C:\Users\Wasiejen\AppData\Local\Temp\opencode\opencode-dev` (v1.18.32)
   IS the installed build's source — provenance spot-verified: its
   `groups/session.ts` SummarizePayload block is byte-identical to the
   published v1.18.32 tag.
2. **NO per-call keep input exists** — `SummarizePayload =
   {providerID, modelID, auto?}` (groups/session.ts L65-69); the handler
   passes only model + auto to `compactSvc.create` (handlers/session.ts
   L273-294); the budget reads CONFIG only: `preserve_recent_tokens ??
   clamp(0.25*usable, 2k..15k)` (compaction.ts L115-120).
3. **The legacy config mapping** `compaction.keep.tokens` →
   `preserve_recent_tokens` (+ `compaction.buffer` → `reserved`) in
   config/v2-compat.ts normalizeCompaction (L163-184) explains the
   config-wins live series from his compaction_tests.md.
4. **Budget consumption** (`select`, compaction.ts L223-269): whole turns,
   newest→oldest, under an estimated-token metric (`Token.estimate(JSON
   stringify model messages)`); the first over-budget turn may split at a
   message boundary; retention snaps to turn boundaries (his test-#9
   "rounding" question: yes).
5. **Floor** = system prompt + summary only when the budget keeps no turn
   (his tests #11/#12 measured 25.8-25.9k — consistent).
6. **Fallback ruling confirmed**: the config `compaction.keep.tokens`
   (his opencode.jsonc) is the ONLY retention control on the installed
   host; nothing to wire. No code change — the body `keep.*` fields stay
   (dead but harmless, server ignores extras, live-verified); the computed
   keepTokens stays advisory (the COMPACT line's `tok=`).

## Open residual (maintainer, live, on 1.18.32)

- **N=10 discriminator**: the 2026-09-26 fork observation (FULL 30-message
  tail retained despite a 30k budget) contradicts 1.18.32's `select()` —
  version drift 1.18.31→1.18.32 is the candidate explanation; the test
  (protocol in the research doc) resolves count-vs-budget semantics.
- **Summarize-scope probe** (scripts/log/summarize_intercept.cjs).

## Part 2 — maintainer in-session GO: bt live acceptance + #103 + #104 (2026-09-27, same session)

The maintainer's in-session message (after the part-1 close) gave GO for #103
+ #104, an explicit approval-boundary ruling (recorded in the NAP
Standing: agent-usage-facing plugin/tool improvements pre-approved —
improvement/truthfulness/friction-removal; maintainer-usage changes still
need a call), and noted "I restarted opencode — so live acceptance of bt
can take place".

- **bt live acceptance — ALL 3 PASS** (live tool calls, scratch fixture
  created + deleted): (a) digit-string refs resolve as 1-based line
  numbers; (b) an anchor typed WITH the line's leading indentation
  matches (plan25-b trim); (c) a not-found anchor error carries the
  closest candidate lines. plan25's fixes are live-accepted.
- **#104 LANDED (planner-direct, `e57f8a3`)**: the plugin core
  `matchAnchorPrefixLines` now MIRRORS the block_transfer tool's plan25-b
  anchor-side trim EXACTLY (S31 equivalence restored in the trim
  dimension) — an anchor typed with the line's indentation matches; an
  all-whitespace anchor matches nothing. Probe check 317 re-pinned
  (`"  beta"` → [2,3,5], all-whitespace anchor → []) + check 318 gains
  the `"  Dup"` drift fixture (pre-fix it would have diverged: tool
  [2,3] vs core []); headers updated. Gate: probe 345/345 + io 77/77.
- **#103 LANDED (planner-direct, `fcc0fc8`)**: the gauge readout now
  reads **ctx = TOTAL (in+out+cr)** of the last FINISHED step (was
  total−output) — the structural 2-turn lag is gone; the readout lags
  the live context by ONE generated turn (the in-flight step's output,
  not yet in the DB). `gauge.mjs` gaugeFromRaw + header; probe S6/S7/S12
  re-pinned (FX_OK → `CTX=12345 (4%) REM=243655`; ses_fx_old →
  `CTX=12345 (10%) REM=107655`) + S8/S9 fixture rows rebuilt to the new
  semantics (total = the intended readout value) + gauge_core smoke
  re-pinned. Gate: probe 345/345 + gauge_core ALL PASS + ctx_gauge 3/3 +
  io 77/77. Lag wording (≈2 → ≈1 tool call) updated in the role prompts
  (planner + worker), repo_custom_tools, and the ctx_gauge tool
  description — AGENTS.md §Context budget + the compaction guide are his
  files (NOT edited — noted in the NAP as pending his paste).
- One routine self-compaction mid-unit (81 % → 33 %; the #104 commit was
  the green checkpoint it closed at).

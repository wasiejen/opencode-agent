  --comment: reworked keepToken calc (computeKeepTokens) in .opencode\plugin\compaction_core.ts 2 times
  total_token after each message is always in+out+cache(cr)
  "info.tokens: {input, output, cache.read}")
  (see knowledge_inbox.md ## 2026-09-27_00-23 planner_Q3S_245K_slow ses_f20b3bf14ffedWHp2HGajHmGLN)
  --todo: gauge needs to be updated to the same calc based on in+out+cr and thus should then only lag one tool call behind and no longer 2 (lacks the out (generated token of last message) part currently it seems) 
    - might already be the last todo by a fork of planner-24

ses_f1e0ff3c2fferuiucMot42aF3M keep=30m tok=44865, after compaction 25k, loaded 56k

keepToken seems to not have any effect at all
- overwritten by defaults in opencode.json?
- commented out both keepToken and keepMessages in opencode.json
    //"tokens": 30000,
    //"messages": 22

--- restarted opencode

ses_f1e061042ffeHdnNvr7nzAdAtz keep=30m tok=44878; after 35k, loaded 42k

- so definitely the opencode.json settings were respected instead of the supplied keepToken
- set "tokens": 44878, in opencode.json
    "tokens": 44878,
    //"messages": 30

ses_f1e0052abffeCyKVV3fkGh5AW8 keep=30m tok=45056, after compaction 35k, loaded 42k

- i no longer know what to think about this at all.

    // "tokens": 44878,
    "messages": 30

ses_f1dfadca9ffe3d8HSretcFpKk2 keep=30m tok=44857, after compaction 34.3k, loaded 42k

- why?

    "tokens": 44878,
    "messages": 30

ses_f1df63454ffetsFTJxpxIiaOQ3 keep=30m tok=44903, after compaction 35.1k, loaded 42.7k

- so no influence of the settings in opencode.json? but it changed something on first commenting out. but not back again on ..
- i am dump .. i forgot to restart opencode after commenting out both.
- so all tests were with commented out keep values again and again.. this explains the same numbers.

--- restarted opencode

#10 ses_f1de9ff3dffev2LxstI2wSn2Aj keep=30m tok=45088, after compaction 35k, after 42.6k

- so keepMessages in opencode.json is ignored
- only keepToken is recogniced and the value in opencode.json is used for all. the compact_memory keep settings do not take effect at all

-keeptoken might round up/down internally to the next full message it lands in? thus 56k (keeptoken 30k) to 68k (keeptoken 44878) -> diff 12/13k

TLDR: current compact_memory implementation does not change the keep settings. these are always taken from opencode.json keep.tokens. keep.messages in opencode.json is ignored as expected.
-> so how to correctly input keep.token into the summerize function

TUI display for after compaction is highly unreliable - so we should not base the expected floor on this. only what is prefilled on loading the context after compaction and can be measured via gauge should be taken into account.

    "tokens": 1, /deliberately not used 0 because i think 0 is automatic? keeptken system?
    //"messages": 30

#11 ses_f1dd756c1ffeeTw9uqEv0G0592 keep=30m tok=45005, after compaction 49.9k, loaded 25.8k
- lets define this as the floor: 25.8k
  - +45 is roughly 72k, so there is some rounding done, or a minimum of keeptoken is already in the 25.8k (so around 4k is default to be kept? or is the summery counting into the keeptoken budged?)

      "tokens": 0,
      //"messages": 30
--- opencode restarted

#12 ses_f1dd359cdffe431xN2YbtC3FQa keep=30m tok=45103, after compaction 49.9k, loader 25.9k

- so 25.8k/25.9k is the ground floor currently (system prompt + summery)
- "tokens": 0 -> activates no automatic system to determine keepToken on its own

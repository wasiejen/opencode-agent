# TODO records — closed entries

One-line records; resolution lives in the file / git log. Moved out of `TODO.md` on
2026-09-10 (planner curation per maintainer call — removes ~6 k chars of closed history
from the live file).

**Numbering rule:** every ID used here is RESERVED and never reused — new entries in
`TODO.md` continue from the last used ID (counter in the root `TODO.md` header:
currently #124, next = #125). FST records moved to `projects/Free-Snap-Tap/

Pre-carve hash note (2026-09-30, plan45, #123): the 2026-09-29 filter-repo carve rewrote the entire history — every 7-hex hash cited below from before 2026-09-29 is a dead revision in the post-carve repo (historical text, not a live pointer). Measured remaps: cbbebf8→7a9e291 (#106), 0c90abe→60f031b (#115), 12e3262→fea1cbb (#114), 44c50a2→9e91878 (R3 import fix). The 4 pairs are re-pointed inline; the remaining dead citations are annotated by this line.
todo_records.md` on 2026-09-29 (#117 per-project split).

## 12. v1.1 task spec "exactly 5 lines" off-by-one — CLOSED (planner record, 2026-09-08) — the off-by-one was on the spec side (the filter deterministically yields 4); the reusable invariant = "one line per unskipped payload" — used by the v2 tasks.

## 13. `handover.ts` header self-labelled "v1" — CLOSED (planner, 2026-09-09) — the v2/v2.2 header rewrite replaced the v1 label; the v2.2.2 + v1.3 header notes landed in the same file.

## 14. transform hook exposes no agent identifier — CLOSED (superseded, 2026-09-08) — the open "choose a planner-only signal" call is moot: the maintainer's 'both' decision (#18) formally overrode "never inject for all" (v2.2 removed the gate); v2.4 targets the just-received last message (ALL agents) — no planner-only signal is needed any more.

## 15. AGENTS.md plan-state routine vs "workers never touch handover_planner.md" — CLOSED (maintainer call → #26, 2026-09-08) — workers never edit or commit the plan-state file (prompt clause + `permission.edit` deny); the pre-commit routine applies to the planner's own commit only.

## 16. v1.2 byte-budget arithmetic (190 vs 150, "< 4 KB" infeasible) — CLOSED (planner, 2026-09-08) — budget target = cascade window 0 B (met); the mixed-window total was spec arithmetic, not a code target; the event count settled by cycle measurement.

## 18. ctxgauge 'both' decision — inject ALL sessions (v2.2 gate removed) — CLOSED (maintainer decision, 2026-09-08) — the formal override of the planner-only design; the companion worker stop-line rule landed 2026-09-09 (#29 item 3); the accepted caveat (gauge = most-recently-updated session only) carries on in #17/#30/#31/#32/#33.

## 19. stale inline comment above `onSystemTransform` — CLOSED (#20, 2026-09-08) — comment rewired per the v2.2 'both' decision (comment-only edit, probe 23/23 both sides).

## 20. persistent offline probe + exact executable pinned — CLOSED (2026-09-08) — the probe is permanent at `.opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs` (run it, never rebuild — exception: a hook-surface change); the exe pin was superseded 2026-09-09 by system `node` (the electron host is gone — #29).

## 21. `ctxgauge/peek.py` fresh-session TypeError crash — CLOSED (code side #24, 2026-09-08) — the `None`-row guard + explicit model-id parse; the v2-schema-migration note rides into #30 (write against the CURRENT schema).

## 22. worker-proof task spec pointed at `.opencode/plugin/log` — CLOSED (2026-09-08) — doc-only mismatch measured against the real path (`.opencode/plugin.log`); the task file is per-cycle and already superseded.

## 23. worker prompt carried NO `ctx:` line — CLOSED (planner, 2026-09-09, `kind:"gauge"` evidence) — not a transform-scope issue: the gauge READOUT was failing (23× `shell-missing` + 47× `no-ctx-output` — the v2 call shape rejected by the live BunShell); the root cause (the call shape) fixed in v2.2.2 (#29); the 09-10 cache-discipline correction (#31) superseded the "session-start-only" reading.

## 24. `peek.py` crash fix + model-id parse (code side of #21) — CLOSED (planner direct fix, 2026-09-08) — fallback to the latest FINISHED message overall + `CTX=0 (0%) REM=<window>` guard; model id from `session.model`'s JSON `id` field.

## 25. `opencode.jsonc` planner edit-permission pattern still `/tmp/**` — CLOSED (#26, `6523406`, 2026-09-08) — the old planner permission block replaced wholesale (Windows temp path).

## 26. workers denied on `handover_planner.md` + prompt clause — CLOSED (maintainer call, 2026-09-08, `6523406`) — `permission.edit` deny on all three worker scopes + the prompt clause; closed #15 + #25 with it.

## 27. v2.2.1 gauge-failure evidence log — CLOSED (planner, 2026-09-09) — the evidence log landed (4-reason vocabulary + `preview`, probe 28/28); the follow-up single opencode start named the branch (`no-ctx-output` + tagged-template preview) → #23/#29.

## 28. `GAUGE_CMD` constant declared but unused — CLOSED (already removed in the `b8ea40b` cycle, 2026-09-09) — verified against the live file (no such constant; probe 28/28) — the entry had been left open by oversight.

## 29. Electron → terminal/CLI + system Node; BunShell `input.$` gauge host — CLOSED (planner, 2026-09-09 — proof start performed) — worker + planner prompts carry `ctx:` (43423/36 % + 13837/12 %) with NO plugin.log read; the v1.3-profile measurement is deferred by the no-log constraint → #17; the fire-scope reading was corrected 09-10 (EVERY LLM build — #31).

## 31. v2.4 per-message injection via `chat.message` (cache-safe append to the last message only) — CLOSED (design + root-cause record, 2026-09-10) — root cause: `experimental.chat.system.transform` fires on EVERY LLM build = prompt-cache invalidation (the 09-09 "session-start-only" reading was a misread); v2.4 = append-only ctx TextPart onto the just-received last message — full record: NAP 09-10 correction + v2.4 blocks; the live fix continued as #32 (v2.4.1).

## 38. (TEST) explorer smoke test — jill gemmaQ4-256K first launch — CLOSED (planner verified, 2026-09-10, `452de1a`) — smoke test PASSED (spec read, one marked entry appended, TODO.md-only commit, fast stop ~45 s); CAVEAT: its final self-gauge line was FABRICATED (no session step carries that ctx; numbers internally inconsistent — format mimicry without running the command) — check explorer output numbers.

## 32. v2.4 part-schema SchemaError = v2.4.1 + v2.5 nudge ladder spec — CLOSED (maintainer restart live-clean, 2026-09-10) — the root cause + design record: the LIVE `chat.message` input carries only `{sessionID, agent, model}` (no `messageID` — proven from the plugin's OWN scoped evidence reads); the v2.5 nudge ladder spec → #33; the target-scope pre-build call lives at section item 3 (NOT dropped).

## 260908-0951 (NAP-copied dedup block) — DEDUP (2026-09-08) — item 1 (116–117 unreachable) → #4; item 2 (lint 6→8 at `ca61a26`) → #5; item 3 (C-class lines covered as by-products — expected state confirmed) → record only (no open work); item 4 (302–303 unreachable + 707 empty-macro contradiction) → #6 + #7.

## 17. v1.3 log-growth confirmation — CLOSED (planner, 2026-09-11, approved one-shot read) — post-base segment (base 1269, new base 2474) of `.opencode/plugin.log`: the three silenced types (`file.watcher.updated`/`file.edited`/`session.idle`) = 0 (expected ≈79 % event-line cut verified in kind — they were the growth driver); residual event lines are low-frequency lifecycle only (54 of 1205 lines: message.removed 25, session.created 13, session.error 12, session.compacted 1, todo.updated 1, permission.asked/replied 1+1); new log base 2474 recorded in the NAP.

## 30. De-peek — CLOSED (planner, 2026-09-11) — the node:sqlite build completed 2026-09-10 (core + v2.5 wiring + probe, token semantics verified); the open tails resolved this cycle: v1.3 log-profile rebaseline done (the #17 one-shot read) + #34 residual doc refs gone (live prompts + repo parts grep-clean; the AGENTS.md copy in `proposals/files/` is archived; `playground/` excluded as maintainer-personal per the date-sweep scope rule).

## 35. T1 de-peek build — CLOSED (planner, 2026-09-11) — build scope complete since 2026-09-10 (continuation 2); the remaining tail (v1.3 rebaseline + #34 doc refs) resolved this cycle — see the #17 + #30 records.

## 39. Looprunner prompt v2 proposal — applied + smoke test clean (2026-09-10) (closed 2026-09-10, full text moved from TODO.md)

- **Problem / evidence:** the current `.opencode/prompt_looprunner.md` (27 lines) is
  ambiguous in four places: no closing-action protocol (the loop always restarts until
  the runner hits 85 %), the maintainer-message routing rule ("Ignore the messages you
  get from the user/maintainer") is imprecise, "create a summary" is due exactly at the
  point where writing headroom is gone, and the embedded planner task text carries
  typos — one functional: it names a NON-EXISTENT explorer agent
  (`worker_explorer_jill_gemmaQ4_256K`; the real key is
  `worker_explorer_jill_gemma_256K_mtp`).
- **Outcome (goal):** the looprunner prompt coordinates the loop as a small explicit
  state machine (restart / ask_maintainer / stop) with a verbatim console log and a
  mechanical suggestion-capture channel.
- **Acceptance:** the maintainer applied the consolidated proposal
  `.opencode/looprunner_prompt_proposal_planner.md` (full replacement prompt text + the
  scoped `opencode.jsonc` permission change for `looprunner_Q4_120k`: edit allow for
  `.opencode/prompt_looprunner.md` + `.opencode/loop_log.md` only) and one smoke-test
  cycle (launch → closing message → action line → restart) runs clean.
- **Scope (non-exhaustive):** `.opencode/prompt_looprunner.md`, `opencode.jsonc`
  (both maintainer-owned — the agents must not edit them).
- **Status:** OPEN — MAINTAINER CALL (section above, item 6). Planner-authored
  consolidated proposal (2026-09-10, autonomous session 2) — point-by-point verdicts on
  the looprunner's 8-point proposal and the gemini proposal live in the proposal doc.
  NOT adopted: `loop_state.json`, default `action: resume`, CLI launch.
- **2026-09-10 (session 3) — APPLIED:** the maintainer applied the proposal — the live
  `prompt_looprunner.md` now carries the v2 text (closing action protocol, `@loop`/
  `@looprunner` routing, 80 %/85 % loop hygiene, verbatim suggestions divider, the
  explorer agent name typo FIXED, plus two maintainer additions: "check first if there
  is unfinished work from an interrupted session" and "explorer = fallback when no
  actionable items are left"); `opencode.jsonc` has the scoped edit-allow (prompt +
  loop_log).
- **2026-09-10 (autonomous session 4 — CLOSED, planner-verified):** the smoke-test
  cycle ran clean — session 3 closed with an `action: restart` line and the loop
  restarted this session with the maintainer messages routed verbatim into the
  prompt (routing + action protocol + NAP-edit permission all working). Acceptance
  met → CLOSED.

## 37. Production plugin host lacks `node:sqlite` — the ctx nudge never lands in production (2026-09-10) (closed 2026-09-10, full text moved from TODO.md)

- **Problem / evidence:** the v2.5 match-only post (`313e83b`) is live after the maintainer
  restart (planner session `ses_f773b9c5…`): the `chat.message` hook FIRES for the planner's
  own session (scoped live read of `.opencode/plugin.log`, prompted by the maintainer's
  "test the nudge mechanism" task — chatmsg line, `midSrc=input`), but the gauge read fails
  on every fire: `kind:"gauge" reason:db-error preview:"sqlite-module ResolveMessage: No such
  built-in module: node:sqlite"` (Bun error format = the bun-based opencode.exe host).
  Consequence: NO `ctx:` line reaches ANY agent in production; the never-throw guard + the
  per-fire evidence line work exactly as designed (no post, no crash, silence otherwise).
  The worker's "bun 1.4.2 host-proxy check: PASS" (#30 status line) tested the SYSTEM bun —
  which DOES expose node:sqlite — NOT the bun baked into opencode.exe: the proxy check
  measured the wrong host and gave false confidence.
- **Outcome (goal):** the gauge read succeeds under the PRODUCTION opencode.exe host, so the
  injected ctx line (and the T2 nudge ladder, which depends on the read — #33) can actually
  fire; one implementation, never-throw preserved.
- **Acceptance:** after a maintainer restart, a `ctx: SESSION=<own sid> CTX=…` line reaches
  the planner's own session (chatmsg fire with NO db-error line); probe 33/33 (extend it if
  the core gains a second backend); no NEW gauge-failure reasons.
- **Scope (non-exhaustive):** `.opencode/ctxgauge/gauge.mjs` backend selection (options the
  host facts support: try `node:sqlite` → fall back to `bun:sqlite`, OR spawn the
  maintainer-placed `.opencode/plugin/tools/sqlite3.exe` — proven live by the retired v1.x
  backend); the plugin itself stays unchanged or minimal; probe S4/S6 fixtures if the read
  mechanic changes.
- **Status:** OPEN — maintainer call (which backend path for the bun host; the read must
  work before T2 #33 can fire). The on-disk `sqlite3.exe` (#30 flag-only, do not delete) is
  a ready-made fallback option. Next-session resume order: 1) #37 maintainer call + fix,
  2) launch `worker_explorer_jill_gemmaQ4_256K` (standing goal; CHECK its findings — fast
  but dumb; its edits are allow-listed to TODO.md/handover_task.md/scratchpad), 3) T2 #33
  (blocked on #37), 4) #34 residual doc refs. Note: the NAP could NOT be updated this
  session — `planner_Q4_120K`'s opencode.jsonc permission block denies
  `.opencode/handover_planner.md` (copy-paste from the worker profiles; the older
  `planner_Q3_120k_mtp` block does not have it) — flagged to the maintainer.
- **2026-09-10 (autonomous session 1 — build LANDED):** the backend fallback chain is
  implemented in the shared core (`node:sqlite` → `bun:sqlite` → spawn `sqlite3.exe`,
  per-process cache, readout forms byte-identical, never-throw preserved; NO plugin
  change needed) + probe extended to 45/45 (S7 forces each backend; the REAL
  sqlite3.exe end-to-end on fixtures) + host proofs: system node peek green, system
  bun 1.4.2 proxy green (all three backends on the live WAL db; bun:sqlite API
  verified as `{readonly:true,timeout:N}` — NOT the spec sketch's `readWrite` — and
  `get()`→`null` no-row). Suite 434/434 + ruff F=0. The worker (Q4_120K) built it and
  was killed by the planner's 40-min CLI timeout at the final renumber step; the
  planner finished (check-ID fix + final verifications). PRODUCTION EVIDENCE PENDING
  maintainer restart (a `ctx: SESSION=<own sid>` line must reach the planner session
  with NO db-error line). NOT closed.
- **2026-09-10 (autonomous session 3 — production evidence in → CLOSED):** after the
  maintainer restart, the line `ctx: SESSION=ses_f76b0f74affeKJEu0HdQerFNHv CTX=notAvailable`
  reached the planner's own session with the first user message — NO db-error line (the
  bun-host backend chain `node:sqlite` → `bun:sqlite` → spawn `sqlite3.exe` works in
  production; `notAvailable` = correct readout for a session without a finished step yet,
  cross-checked: the same session's later self-gauge read `CTX=27215 (22%)` cleanly).
  Acceptance met → CLOSED (planner, session 3). Tail note: the v1.3 log-profile
  rebaseline remains #30 / maintainer call 1 (default SKIP — not done autonomously).

## 38. (TEST) explorer smoke test — jill gemmaQ4-256K first launch (closed 2026-09-10, full text moved from TODO.md)

CLOSED (planner verified, 2026-09-10): smoke test PASSED — the explorer read the spec,
appended this entry, committed ONLY `TODO.md` (`452de1a`), stopped fast (~45 s session).
CAVEAT recorded: its final self-gauge line `CTX=14329 (11%) REM=241058` is FABRICATED —
no finished step of its session carries that ctx, and the numbers are internally
inconsistent for any window (14329/256k would be 5 % / REM 241671): it pattern-matched
the required final-line format without running the command. Fast-but-dumb signal for
the maintainer (check explorer work; the number itself is unverifiable).

## 34. Stale `peek.py` documentation refs + worker prompt permission block (closed 2026-09-10, full text moved from TODO.md)

CLOSED — all agent-facing docs now self-peek via `node .opencode\ctxgauge\peek.mjs`
(readout `SESSION=… CTX=… (…) REM=…`): prompt files (`a235886`, planner execution — the
worker was blocked by the `.opencode/prompt_**` deny) + `agents_repo.md` gauge line
(~164) and module-map line (~122) (explicit maintainer instruction, 2026-09-10).
Residual refs (frozen `deactivated/handover.ts` copy, `playground/outline_rework_prompts.md`
draft, historical files/records) = LEFT AS HISTORICAL. **2026-09-10 (260910, maintainer):**
"#34 is stale and closed? why ask for decision?" — the residual refs stay historical, NO
call needed (the NAP call bundle drops the #34 residual).

## 36. `agents_repo.md` `Environment & shell` — wrong/stale lines (lab-verified, fixed) (closed 2026-09-09, full text moved from TODO.md)

One-line record: the section (previously 48 lines) was validated in fresh-worker
first-shot batteries (T1–T10, pwsh + git-bash) and compacted 48→24 lines; round 2
ended 10/10 first-shot. Corrected/verified facts now in the section: `ConvertTo-Path`
does NOT exist in pwsh 7.6 (the old text suggested it — guaranteed first-shot failure);
`$env:NO_COLOR='1'` does NOT suppress ANSI codes in table output; env var `FST` value
carries a trailing `\`; bare `python` on PATH = 3.14.3 without repo deps (fake-starts,
then import-fails — always venv exe); scalar listing recipe needs `-File`; `pwd -W`
prints forward slashes. Status: closed — section committed as tested.

## 49. `handover_task.md` worktree/HEAD conflict (2026-09-10) (closed 2026-09-11)

One-line record: maintainer call — the worktree held the LANDED part-3 spec (byte-identical
to `854bb68`) while HEAD held the split-build spec (`8b4123b`); the maintainer resolved it
directly (`b6dc3e7` "cleaned up commit mess" — restored lost updates, HEAD split-build spec
canonical, tree clean) → closed; the split build launched per the committed spec.

## 40. Explorer run #1 output unreliable (2026-09-10) - CLOSED (maintainer ruling 2026-09-10: the gemma agent option removed, verified in the live opencode.jsonc; curated 2026-09-11, iter 5) - the audit re-run goal was completed via audit 3a/3b (session 4; #48 is the only open audit residual); the gauge-fabrication caveats stand as the explorer-output-check lesson (verify numbers against the real command).

## 50. (closed 2026-09-11, planner-direct, approved by maintainer inbox 11-11) — repo_map.md refresh: (a) §Worker-roster explorer bullet "findings to `TODO.md`" → "findings to `todo_inbox.md` (the planner curates + assigns the TODO IDs)"; (b) §Module-map `.opencode/` bullet now lists `system_readme/` parts + `agent_readme_*.md` readmes + the `loop/` current-looprun / `archive/loop/` history convention (and drops the stale "draft copies in `proposals/files/`" — they are archived). "Stable facts only" kept — no phase progress introduced.

## 17. (closed 2026-09-11, see one-line record above) — v1.3 log-growth CONFIRMATION — one-shot read, deferred by the no-`plugin.log` constraint (2026-09-08)

- **Problem / evidence:** the old-profile measurement (v1.1+v2 era): the delegation cycle
  grew the log to 1036 lines / 571 KB in 5 min (≈0.9 KB/s — the "rapid growth" complaint,
  quantified); child-session lines ≈47 % of total; the residual unsilenced types were
  `file.watcher.updated` ×41, `file.edited` ×7, `session.idle` ×1. v1.3 = silence exactly
  those — landed 2026-09-09 (#29 item 3) — but the live byte-ratio of that extension has
  NOT been measured; measuring requires a read of `plugin.log`, which the standing
  maintainer constraint forbids except ONE scoped, one-shot read on request.
- **Outcome (goal):** take the v1.3 profile — ONE scoped, one-shot read of the retained
  log's post-base segment; expect the three types at 0 + ≈79 % event-line cut; refresh the
  NAP's log base (currently 1269 — STALE on purpose).
- **Acceptance:** measured ratio + new log base recorded in the NAP; this entry closes.
- **Status:** OPEN — MAINTAINER CALL (section above, item 1; default: SKIP unless asked —
  never parse the log unprompted).

## 30. (closed 2026-09-11, see one-line record above) — De-peek: replace the peek.py shell-out with an in-plugin `node:sqlite` read (2026-09-09)

- **Problem / evidence:** the gauge shell-outs (`$`-tagged-template → `.venv/Scripts/python.exe
  .opencode/ctxgauge/peek.py`, `handover.ts` ≈301) against the OLD opencode.db schema —
  fragile (fresh-session `fetchone() → None` class of bug, #21/#24). `node:sqlite` is
  built into the probe node v24.19.0 (confirm exposed on the system CLI host — it was
  absent in the electron host).
- **Outcome (goal — ONE cycle, APPROVED):** (1) in-plugin `node:sqlite` gauge landing +
  peek.py removal (`.opencode/ctxgauge/` delete, unless the maintainer keeps a
  standalone-CLI copy — his call) + doc purge (`AGENTS.md` COPY — the original is
  agent-read-only — + `prompt_agent_planner.md` + `prompt_agent_task.md`); (2) re-baseline
  the v1.3 log-profile measurement in the SAME cycle (landing de-peek re-baselines the
  gauge host — the probe's S4 fake-shell gauge shapes must be rebuilt per the #20
  exception); (3) the read is written against the CURRENT opencode.db schema (`session` /
  message-token JSON; model id from `session.model`'s `id`) and guards the fresh-session
  case like peek.py does (no finished message ⇒ `CTX=0`, never throw into the transform) —
  this replaces the parked #21 v2-schema note.
- **Carry-over caveat (UNVERIFIED, from the 2026-09-09 dirty `peek.py` diff, committed with
  that entry):** "should total not be the most current total token number? output should
  be the generated tokens for the last message so it should be substract output from
  total" — i.e. `total − output` may already be the right readout — CHECK the token-field
  meaning BEFORE wiring the same arithmetic into handover.ts; record the verified meaning
  when done.
- **Acceptance:** no python shell-out on the gauge path; probe passes (rebuilt S4); the
  doc references purged (AGENTS.md via the hand-over copy); token semantics recorded here.
- **Scope:** `.opencode/plugin/handover_v2.4.ts` (readout ≈301), `.opencode/plugin/scripts/`
  (the gauge core + self-peek CLI — moved out of the former `.opencode/ctxgauge/` on
  2026-09-10), `prompt_agent_planner.md`, `prompt_agent_task.md`, the AGENTS.md copy.
- **Token semantics — VERIFIED (record per this cycle's task fact 3, closes the
  carry-over caveat above):** `total = input + output + cache.read` holds EXACTLY across all
  recent step rows → `ctx = total − output` = the exact prompt size at the latest finished
  step = current context at that moment (measured 2026-09-10; the implemented read-out is built on this).
- **Backend ruling (2026-09-09, maintainer):** the node:sqlite design is SUPERSEDED — the
  plugin host (opencode.exe, a bun-compiled binary) cannot be trusted with node:sqlite (the
  T1 worker could not solve a sqlite call via node modules there). The core now spawns the
  maintainer-placed `.opencode/plugin/tools/sqlite3.exe` (args array, `file:…?mode=ro`,
  marker SQL `M|…`/`S|…`, no PRAGMA in the call — its echo pollutes stdout). Verified live
  under node v24.19.0 + bun 1.4.2; the worker's digit corruption (multiplier `105` →
  `100`/`1000`) fixed; window rule = trailing `<N>K` × 1000 exactly, last marker wins
  (maintainer-confirmed).
- **Backend RE-RULING (2026-09-10, maintainer):** the sqlite3.exe spawn backend is
  SUPERSEDED — back to built-in `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`; node v24.19.0 flag-free per
  fact 1 of the task spec). Rationale: the 3bit Q3 workers lost coherence on the SQL/JSON
  detail work; the build now runs on the 4bit same-model worker `worker_Q4_120K`
  (maintainer restart with the new roster). The bun-compiled opencode.exe host risk is
  guarded by the never-throw `db-error` fallback; the worker records a bun 1.4.2 host-proxy
  check; production evidence = maintainer restart + one-shot log read (call 1).
  `sqlite3.exe` stays on disk (maintainer-placed, now unused — do not delete).
- **Status:** LANDING (2026-09-10, continuation 2 — node:sqlite re-ruling) —
  plugin wiring + probe + node:sqlite core landed this cycle — log-profile
  re-baseline pending maintainer restart + one-shot log read (call 1, default
  SKIP). bun 1.4.2 host-proxy check: PASS (core import + `readGauge()` green
  under system bun, kind=ok on the live db). The build scope is complete (core
  node:sqlite-only, v2.5 plugin wiring + probe 33/33, peek.py deleted); do NOT
  close — the log-profile tail + #34 residual doc refs remain open.
  **2026-09-10 (evening, production restart evidence):** the read fails under the
   PRODUCTION bun host (`db-error`, no `node:sqlite` — Bun error format) → no ctx line
   lands; see #37 (the bun-1.4.2 system-bun proxy check measured the wrong host).
   **2026-09-10 (T2 #33): ladder build LANDED —** per-session read (gauge.mjs optional
  sessionID param) + the v2.6 nudge ladder in handover_v2.4.ts + probe S8 (checks
  46-53; 52/52 PASS, exit 0) + suite 434/434 + ruff F=0; production evidence (a forced
  high-readout nudge after a maintainer restart) PENDING.

## 35. (closed 2026-09-11, see one-line record above) — T1 de-peek build — LANDED (continuation 2); tail open: v1.3 log-profile re-baseline (call 1) + #34 residual doc refs (2026-09-10)

- **Problem / evidence:** T1 build (task file `.opencode/handover_task.md`) stopped at the
  context stop-line: self-gauge read at stop time `CTX=106441 (87%)` (≈14 k left vs. ≈45–50 k
  estimated for the remainder). Landed + committed: shared gauge core (`ctxgauge/gauge.mjs`)
  + self-peek CLI (`ctxgauge/peek.mjs`, verified live against the real DB) + peek.py
  deletion + suite 434/434. NOT landed (spec DoD pending): the v2.5 plugin wiring in
  `handover_v2.4.ts` (native gauge import + session-gated match-only post + `sess` evidence
  field + db-error vocabulary + header block + dead shell mechanism deletion), the probe
  rebuild (currently pointing at the deleted `handover.ts` — stale; S4/S6 shapes per spec),
  the doc purge (#34), the v1.3 log-profile rebaseline (call 1, default SKIP).
- **Outcome (goal):** T1 completed per spec (probe `PROBE handover: N/N PASS`, suite 434/434,
  `peek.mjs` prints the `SESSION=…` line — this one already holds — plugin lands the gated read, #30/#33 tail updates, commit).
- **Acceptance:** task file DoD items 1–5 all true.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/handover_v2.4.ts`, `.opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs`, doc files in #34, `TODO.md`.
- **Status:** OPEN — the T1 build scope itself is COMPLETE (2026-09-10, continuation 2 —
  see the status tail below); remaining tail = the v1.3 log-profile rebaseline + #34
  residual doc refs. 2026-09-09 update:
  the sqlite-via-node:sqlite problem is SOLVED per maintainer ruling — the core
  (`ctxgauge/gauge.mjs` + `peek.mjs`) landed on the sqlite3.exe backend (planner-direct,
  verified live, corruption fixed; task file now carries a PLANNER RULING block). Remaining
  continuation scope: plugin wiring (session-gated match-only post) + probe rebuild +
  suite/ruff + peek.py deletion + #30/#35 status lines — per the ruling block + DoD.
  2026-09-10: backend RE-RULING (node:sqlite, see #30) — the committed core's sqlite3.exe
  read mechanic is re-implemented in continuation 2; the 3bit 210K delegation looped
  (no partial commits, verified via git log); re-delegated to `worker_Q4_120K`.
  **2026-09-10 (continuation 2 — LANDED):** node:sqlite core + v2.5 plugin wiring +
  probe rebuild (33/33) + suite 434/434 + ruff F=0 + peek.py deletion committed;
  remaining tail = the v1.3 log-profile rebaseline (maintainer call 1) + #34
  residual doc refs (planner/maintainer-owned).

## 52. `compact_memory` fails in the current host build — connection error on both paths (2026-09-12, planner ses_f6b7c5242ffeZpNl0Ar8mILWua)

- **Problem / evidence:** firing the `compact_memory` tool returns
  "Compaction request failed: Unable to connect. Is the computer able to
  access the url?" in the current host build (verified live 2026-09-12).
  Diagnosis (same session, measured): the only opencode process
  (`opencode.exe`) listens on NO TCP port at all; `OPENCODE_PORT` is empty
  → the HTTP fallback targets `localhost:4096`, where nothing listens.
  Definitive key dump (maintainer's `get_context_keys` probe, 2026-09-12):
  contextKeys = sessionID, abort, messageID, callID, extra, agent, messages,
  metadata, ask, directory, worktree — **NO `client` key** (clientKeys /
  sessionKeys empty). So `context.client` IS absent from the tool context in
  this build (the earlier throw was `client` itself being undefined, not a
  missing `.app`). The failure came from the HTTP fallback (no usable client
  + no listener on 4096). The failure did NOT consume the
  per-session compaction budget (no `.opencode/temp/compact_budget.json`
  — increment-on-success holds).
  Installed-SDK evidence (2026-09-12, grepped from
  `.opencode/node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/`): **v1** generated types
  expose only `session.summarize` (url `/session/{id}/summarize`) — NO
  `compact` method; **v2** exposes both `summarize` and `compact`
  (`compact` url `/api/session/{sessionID}/compact`, FLAT `parameters`
  shape). Consequences: (a) the tool's current call
  `client.session.compact({path:{id}, body:{keep}})` mixes generations —
  v1 has no `compact`, v2's `compact` takes flat parameters, so even WITH a
  wired client the call shape is suspect; (b) the HTTP fallback hits
  `/api/session/compact` with the sessionId IN THE BODY — matches NEITHER
  typed endpoint (both are session-ID-in-path); (c) the `context.api`
  fallback is dubious per the maintainer's knowledge doc (not necessarily
  SDK-client-interchangeable).
- **Outcome (goal):** `compact_memory` compacts a live session in the
  current host build via the path this build actually exposes (client
  wiring decision = maintainer domain); if no path exists in this build,
  the tool reports WHICH path was attempted and why it failed (client
  absent / HTTP no-listener / endpoint mismatch) instead of the generic
  "Unable to connect".
- **Acceptance:** a live fire in a session → success (COMPACT line in
  `.opencode/temp/ctx.log` + budget increment), or a maintainer decision
  on the supported host configuration. The chosen call shape must match
  the installed SDK `.d.ts` (grep-verified against
  `sdk/dist/{gen,v2/gen}`); if the HTTP fallback stays, its endpoint is
  `/api/session/{sessionID}/compact` and it only applies when a server is
  actually listening.
- **Scope:** `.opencode/tools/compact_memory.ts` (resolution chain:
  `context.sessionID` first per the knowledge doc; `context.client` only —
  drop the silent `context.api` equivalence; error reporting),
  `.opencode/node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/{gen,v2/gen}/*.d.ts`
  (installed types — the authority for the call shape), the host-side
  client/URL wiring (maintainer domain), the v2 test notes
  (`maintainer/done/compact_memory_v2test.ts` +
  `compaction_warning.md`), the knowledge doc
  (`maintainer/done/knowledge_opencode_tools_plugins.md`).
  Related: the loop_log-v2 proposal's Part A context probe (which context
  fields the host wires — `sessionID`/`agent` confirmed, model open); the
  installed plugin package DOES expose the
  `experimental.session.compacting` hook (candidate alternative design:
  inject durable context AT compaction instead of triggering it).
- **Solution paths (2026-09-12, maintainer Q&A + this session):**
  (1) **Plugin-registered compact tool** — the clean architecture: the
  custom-tool context is clientless BY DESIGN, so a client-needing tool
  must be registered FROM a plugin (plugin `ctx` carries the SDK/RPC
  access; plugins can register tools; the tool's execute still gets
  sessionID/agent). I.e. move `compact_memory` to a plugin-registered
  tool (registration = maintainer domain; the call shape must still match
  the installed SDK `.d.ts` per the evidence above).
  (2) **Compaction hook plugin** (prompt-level) — the maintainer's WIP
  `inbox_planner/custom_compaction.ts` sets `output.prompt` in
  `experimental.session.compacting` to a swarm-oriented resume prompt
  (shape verified against installed plugin types 2026-09-12). Complements
  (1): compaction stays host-triggered (maintainer compacts manually in a
  direct session); the plugin shapes the resulting prompt.
  (Source: `maintainer/done/plugin_exposed_custom_tool.md`.)
- **Status:** LANDED (2026-09-12, worker-2) — the build landed per the
  approved v2 proposal (plugin-registered `compact_memory` at
  `.opencode/plugin/compact_memory.ts`; v1 retired to `plugin/deactivated/`;
  probe S13 checks 86-99, 98/98; live acceptance PENDING: the maintainer's
  registration in `opencode.jsonc` + restart, proposal Acceptance 2-4).
  Design agreed with the maintainer (2026-09-12): plugin-registered tool
  (client via captured plugin ctx; v1 `summarize` path ACTIVE on this build
  + v2 `compact` hedge; keep args optional in the body with a 400-retry;
  cross-session via `sessionID` arg; HTTP fallback + compaction hook
  retired). Proposal:
  `proposals/approved/2026-09-12_compact_memory_plugin.md` (APPROVED).
  Probe evidence: `.opencode/plugin/dev_probe_ctx.ts` (client present in
  plugin ctx; summarize=function, compact=undefined; session methods on
  the prototype → detect with typeof; registration via the `plugins` array;
  the file IS the worked example of a plugin-registered tool — the
   registration shape is verified live).
  - **2026-09-13 (direct session ses_f692e1071ffevodtnJTET0DEEs):** live
    no-op bug FIXED — root cause: the server's `summarize` payload schema
    REQUIRES `providerID` + `modelID` (binary: the handler
    `SessionHttpApi.summarize` reads both from the body; a missing body /
    missing key is a schema rejection → HTTP 404 JSON `{name:"BadRequest"}`
    + a logged WARN "schema rejection" — 6 in the server log, one per fired
    tool, both test sessions). The handler never ran → NO compaction; and
    the host client does NOT throw on the 404 (it resolves) → the old code
    reported a false success and burned a budget slot. Fix: the body ALWAYS
    carries the resolved model pair (self: `extra.model.{id, providerID}`;
    cross: the last message's info, assistant `modelID`+`providerID` / user
    `model` object); an unresolvable pair → the request is NOT sent (clear
    failure, no increment, no COMPACT line); the resolved result is VERIFIED
    (success = the handler's boolean `true`; a resolved 404 JSON is a
    failure carrying the server's message). Probe re-pinned (S13: the retry
    2nd body keeps the pair, the failing-RPC path no-sends) + the S11 RC
    import REPOINTED to `plugin/deactivated/context_recovery.ts` (the
    maintainer's cleanup 4b44d8c moved the file without repointing the
    probe — the probe was broken at HEAD). Gates: probe 98/98, smoke 23/23.
    Live acceptance STILL PENDING: a real fire must show the compaction
    part + the `time_compacting` flag in the DB (verify with
    `Temp/opencode/sesdata.cjs` or `compaudit.cjs`).
- **2026-09-12 (direct session ses_f6976031bffeRa8gNNcpy5FoYj):** model
  field RESOLVED — it is nested, not top-level: `context.extra.model.id`
  (live capture `tools/dev/hot_loaded_tool.ts` + maintainer `--todo` note in
  the loop_log-v2 approval; the earlier key dump listed top-level keys
  only). Feeds the Part 4 quant-class classification (priority.md #1) and
  loop_log-v2 Part A. `priority.md` #1 (his `--wip` item) extends this
  design with the per-model quant-class budget: Q4→3, Q3→1, other→1
  preliminary, CPU models excluded — design grounded in the NAP, awaiting
  his ruling (approval path + CPU- prefix confirmation).
- **CLOSED 2026-09-13 (iteration 1):** live acceptance DONE — a real fire
  (worker-1 `ses_f6765a68bffeudOXmVzLROTYk6` + planner-direct rescue) shows
  the compaction part + reload directive + budget v2 count 1/3 + the COMPACT
  line in the DB; the host runs the fixed plugin (the `2ace5e1` model-pair
  fix). The resume-via-`task_id` context-overflow finding →
  `proposals/2026-09-13_compact_memory-findings.md` (AWAITING APPROVAL;
  item 1: lower the self-compact trigger + server keep support as the
  durable fix; item 2: `time_compacting` semantics ruling).

## #89. (LANDED 2026-09-23, worker-15 `worker_Q3S_170K`) — autorun-identifiable names for plugin-spawned sessions: the auto_resume spawns carry the title `<loop-folder> planner-<N>` (his # 2026-09-23_04-34)
- **Problem + evidence:** sessions the auto_resume plugin SPAWNS (the Unit-3 file-trigger spawn and the Unit-4 restart branch) get auto-resolved names (opencode derives them from context) — the sessions that belong to a loop autorun are not findable by name (maintainer request, priority.md # 2026-09-23_04-34).
- **Desired outcome:** make the loop's spawned sessions identifiable: name = the current loop folder + the next planner iteration (`planner-<N>`, N = the largest `planner-<N>` in that folder's `loop_log.md`, + 1 — the same derivation the planner uses for its iteration number).
- **What landed:** the bounded SDK answer was YES — `session.create()` accepts a title (vendored `@opencode-ai/sdk` types, `.opencode/node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/gen/types.gen.d.ts` L1811: `SessionCreateData.body?: { parentID?, title? }`) → the identifier is passed as `body.title` in the SHARED `spawnPlanner` helper's `create()` call (both spawn paths; `auto_resume.ts`), with an `ident=` bit in the `spawn=` log line; no loop folder / no `loop_log.md` / no `planner-<N>` line → no identifier (the spawn is exactly as before — the prompt-prefix fallback was NOT used).
- **Acceptance:** two new smoke checks (deterministic loop folder `autorun-test_0-0` → title `autorun-test_0-0 planner-8` lands in the create body + `ident=` bit, queued prompt text unchanged; a log with no planner-<N> line → no title, prompt unchanged); auto_resume smoke 104/104 (baseline 102, no removals); gate: all 10 smokes, probe 241/241, pytest 459 passed + 1 warning (#10), ruff F=0 (baselines as of commit 725ab3a, measured at 75566e6).
- **Status:** LANDED (commit 2240d00, recorded in the planner-9 bookkeeping per the commit-hash rule). LIVE acceptance pending: the plugin activates on the next host restart; the planner verifies the first named spawn (out of scope for the worker).

## 84. (LANDED 2026-09-22, worker `worker_Q3S_170K`) — Compaction config consolidation: ALL compaction config in the shared `compact_budget.json` (replaces the `QUANT_CLASS_RULES` substring table + the opencode.jsonc emergency flag + the hardcoded recovery keeps)
- **Problem + evidence:** the compaction caps came from a hardcoded ordered
  substring table (`QUANT_CLASS_RULES`, compact_memory.ts L79-86 — the
  2026-09-21 quant-class ruling with the probe trap pin); the T5 emergency
  flag lived in `opencode.jsonc` (read per fire); context_recovery's keep
  (30_000 / 12) was hardcoded; auto_resume already read its keys from
  compact_budget.json per tick — the config was split across three files
  (2026-09-22 design exchange, recorded in the NAP).
- **Desired outcome:** compact_budget.json is the SINGLE compaction-config
  source: top-level optional fail-open keys `keepTokens` (default 30_000),
  `keepMessages` (12), `emergencyRecovery` (strictly `true`, default false),
  `model_budget` (bare model ID → cap, plus a `default` key, default 1);
  CPU models stay cap 0 as a SAFETY INVARIANT; an unlisted / typo'd model
  id → the configured default (fails safe).
- **Acceptance criteria (all LANDED, measured gate green):**
  `compact_memory.ts` exposes `resolveCap(root, model)` (per-call
  model_budget read) + `readCompactionConfig(root)` (fail-open); keep
  reporting falls back to the file config (explicit args still win);
  `context_recovery.ts` reads flag + keeps from the SAME file (self-
  contained local reader — no runtime import from compact_memory.ts; the
  file STAYS in `deactivated/`); smokes updated (model_budget seed +
  exact/unlisted/typo/CPU fixtures + keep-override + config fail-open
  cases); probe 241/241 (check 87 → the "configured value" fixtures; S11
  checks 77/78 flag from the budget file, the JSONC fixture dropped);
  full gate green — 10/10 plugin smokes, probe 241/241, pytest 459 passed
  + 1 warning, ruff F=0.
- **Suggested scope (actual):** `.opencode/plugin/compact_memory.ts`,
  `.opencode/plugin/deactivated/context_recovery.ts`,
  `.opencode/plugin/tests/compact_memory.smoke.mjs`,
  `.opencode/plugin/tests/context_recovery.smoke.mjs`,
  `.opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs`.
- **Status:** LANDED (2026-09-22, worker `worker_Q3S_170K` — the gate
   green as above; the commit hash is recorded by the planner in the
   follow-up bookkeeping commit, not in this entry's commit).

## 61. (closed 2026-09-15, planner plan5; title reworded plan6) — probe baseline corrected: post-S14 baseline is one-zero-six, not the plan3/plan4-era nine-four

The plan3/plan4 NAP baseline line said ninetyfour — the plan3-era probe,
whose header annotation and per-section list sum AGREED at ninetyfour
(machine-verified plan6 at `a15828c`). After S14 (plan4 build `4512fe6`,
checks 101-107) the self-counted baseline is one-zero-six
(one-zero-six/one-zero-six); annotation and self-count agree at HEAD
(machine-verified plan6; plan5 gate one-zero-six PASS). The original
"annotation stale by 5 hygiene checks (40–43/45/64)" narrative is NOT
corroborated by the commits — the annotation was self-consistent at every
commit checked (`a15828c`/`4512fe6`/`4340043`/HEAD); superseded, original
text recoverable in git (`0761e42`/`4b4153f`). NUMWORDS NOTE retained:
dense X/X numeral pairs are a transcription trap — write them as words in
prose.

## 63. (closed 2026-09-16, plan7 worker-7; finding 2026-09-15 worker-5, planner plan5) — compact_memory smoke: 4 failures at HEAD (dump-hook sandbox gap)

- **Problem / evidence:** `node .opencode/plugin/tests/compact_memory.smoke.mjs`
  → 4 failures that EXIST at clean HEAD (proven by the worker via `git stash`
  before his commit `28783a7`). Suspect cause: the pre-compaction dump hook
  (TODO #55 build, `4512fe6`) writes dump files, and the smoke sandbox /
  mocks do not account for that path (or vice versa). NOTE: the smoke tests
  are NOT in the standard gate (pytest + ruff + probe) — this is why the
  failures went undetected through plan4.
- **Desired outcome:** the 4 smoke failures fixed (either the hook respects
  the smoke sandbox, or the smoke fixtures/mocks are updated for the hook);
  `node .opencode/plugin/tests/compact_memory.smoke.mjs` green.
- **Acceptance criteria:** all plugin smoke tests green (`node
  .opencode/plugin/tests/<name>.smoke.mjs` for each); standard gates
  unchanged (probe 106/106, pytest 459+1w, ruff F=0).
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/compact_memory.ts` (the dump-hook
  call site), `.opencode/plugin/tests/compact_memory.smoke.mjs`,
  `.opencode/agent/scripts/db/dump_session.cjs` (read-only reference).
- **Status:** CLOSED (2026-09-16, plan7 worker-7) — fixed by the smoke stub: the sandbox now carries a byte-identical `dump_session.cjs` stub from the probe S13 preamble (handover_probe.mjs 1983-2015) so the dump hook (4512fe6) succeeds silently + 1 new chk pins the hook firing on the tool path (`compaction_dumps/ses_sm_self_c0.md`); smoke 43/43, all 7 smokes green, gates unchanged (probe 106/106, pytest 459+1w, ruff F=0); fix + this note ride the plan7 closing commit (subject "close #63: compact_memory smoke adapts to the pre-compaction dump hook"). DECISION NEEDED (optional): should the smoke suite join the standard gate in repo_commands.md? (relates to #58's gate-definition entry.)

## 60. (closed 2026-09-16, worker-9, plan7/iter7; 2026-09-15, planner plan5) — `block_transfer` + `loop_log` lack probe pinning

- **Problem / evidence:** the custom tools `block_transfer` and `loop_log`
  (`.opencode/tools/*.ts`) have smoke tests (`plugin/tests/block_transfer*.smoke.mjs`,
  `loop_log.smoke.mjs`) but ZERO handover-probe pinning (`grep block_transfer
  handover_probe.mjs` = 0 hits) — contrast `compact_memory` (S10–S14) and
  `ctx_gauge` (S12): their contracts can drift silently with no gate signal.
- **Desired outcome:** a probe section pinning both tools' contracts
  (registration shape, arg schemas, core behavior — sandbox validation for
  block_transfer, the 8-char status tokens + line format for loop_log),
  APPEND-only per the probe discipline.
- **Acceptance criteria:** probe total grows by the new section's check
  count, all green; both smoke tests still pass; header annotation updated.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs`,
  `.opencode/tools/{block_transfer,loop_log}.ts` (read-only reference).
- **Status:** CLOSED 2026-09-16 (worker-9, plan7/iter7) — S15 (10 checks) + S16 (6 checks) appended; probe total 106 -> 120+2 all green (header annotation agrees with the reported total), all 7 smokes green, pytest 459+1 warning, ruff F=0; fix commit 75be075.

## 59. (closed 2026-09-16, plan6; 2026-09-15, script-collection worker, curated plan3) — session-corpus refresh cadence

- **Problem / evidence:** the corpus `.opencode/archive/sessions/` goes stale
  between backfills (e.g. `ses_f5d03802...` was dumped mid-session: 59 msgs
  vs 65 in the DB); the pre-compaction dump hook covers new sessions only.
  PLAN3 (2026-09-15) ran a one-off `dump_session.cjs --all --slim` refresh
  (147 sessions, 0 failures).
- **Desired outcome:** a documented cadence / trigger for corpus refreshes
  (suggestion: before the #56 distillation runs start; after heavy loopruns).
- **Acceptance criteria:** the cadence decision recorded (NAP Standing or the
  scripts README); the corpus refreshable via one documented command
  (`node .opencode/agent/scripts/db/dump_session.cjs --all --slim`).
- **Suggested scope:** the decision record; `.opencode/archive/sessions/`.
- **Status:** CLOSED (planner call, plan6 2026-09-16) — cadence recorded in
  the NAP Standing: refresh BEFORE the #56 distillation runs start + after
  heavy loopruns; command `node .opencode/agent/scripts/db/dump_session.cjs
  --all --slim`.

## 58. (closed 2026-09-16, plan8; 2026-09-15, script-collection worker, curated plan3) — standard gate definition lacks the probe command

- **Problem / evidence:** the standing gate baseline mentions "probe 99/99",
  but the probe command is not defined in `repo_commands.md` §Run / test
  (pytest + ruff only) — the worker had to infer it from the launch baseline
  (worker script-collection, 2026-09-15).
- **Desired outcome:** the gate definition lists all three commands
  (`pytest -q`, `ruff check --select F .`,
  `node .opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs`) so "standard gate" is
  unambiguous for every spec/launch.
- **Acceptance criteria:** `repo_commands.md` §Run / test names the probe
  command with the current baseline (99/99 as of 2026-09-15).
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/agent/readme/repo_commands.md`
  (maintainer-owned file — he edits it or tasks the planner).
- **Status:** CLOSED (2026-09-16, plan8) — `repo_commands.md` §Run/test now
  names the probe command and defines **"standard gate" = pytest + ruff +
  probe** (the probe's total is self-annotated in its header — the annotation
  is the source, no duplicated moving number); his temp-path note landed in
  §Environment & shell as verified fact (git-bash `$TMP/opencode` =
  `C:/Users/Wasiejen/AppData/Local/Temp/opencode`, the approved scratchpad).
  His "add to them as need be — curate, don't duplicate" ruling is the standing
  convention for this file. The #63 optional question (do the plugin smokes
  join the standard gate?) was NOT decided unilaterally — it stays open for
  his direct session.

## 57. (closed 2026-09-16, worker-8, plan7/iter7; 2026-09-15, worker T1 block_transfer sandbox, curated plan3) — block_transfer MOVE silently deletes a block when `dstFile` is missing

- **Problem / evidence:** in `.opencode/tools/block_transfer.ts`, MOVE mode
  extracts the source block (CUT) BEFORE the `'dstFile' is required for MOVE
  mode.` check runs — so a MOVE with `dstFile` missing deletes the block from
  the source file and only THEN errors: silent data loss of the yanked block.
  Pre-existing (pre-T1). Recorded by worker-10 (2026-09-12).
- **Desired outcome:** the `dstFile` requirement is checked before ANY source
  write — a missing `dstFile` yields the error with the source file untouched.
  Valid-input semantics stay byte-identical.
- **Acceptance criteria:** a smoke/assertion proves MOVE with missing
  `dstFile` → error + source file unchanged; the existing block_transfer
  smokes stay green.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/tools/block_transfer.ts` (hoist the
  `!args.dstFile` check to the top of the anchor-extraction section, before
  any write); a smoke in `.opencode/plugin/tests/`.
- **Status:** CLOSED (2026-09-16, worker-8, plan7/iter7) — guard hoisted pre-write: the `!args.dstFile` check now runs before the source-cut write (invalid-input-only change, exact error string kept); 2 new smoke assertions (22/22), gates 106/106 + 459 passed + ruff F=0; commit 733ca7a.
  NOTE 2026-09-16 (plan1): his approval comment on this entry handled — the
  status feedback he requested is in
  `.opencode/maintainer/feedback/2026-09-16_block_transfer_status.md`
  (answers the buffer / sandbox / shared-scriptlet questions).

## 55. (closed 2026-09-17, live-accepted in direct session ses_f4f539d7c…; maintainer call 2026-09-15) — `compact_memory` needs a dump function of the current session

- **Problem / evidence:** compaction (host default AND `compact_memory`) irreversibly
  destroys the fine-grained session context — the pre-compaction messages are gone once
  the summarize lands. A post-compaction dump of that session would miss EXACTLY the
  content that was destroyed. Maintainer 2026-09-15 (direct session, chat mode):
  "moment when we compact, we destroy exactly this ... i have only access to the
  default compact and this would irreversible destroy some part of the sessions
  context. mark this down: compact_memory needs a dump function of the current
  session." Related: the session-corpus discussion 2026-09-15 (readable dumps of all
  sessions from the opencode DB — 130 sessions / 6,125 messages / 27,003 parts verified
  in `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` — as the consolidation basis; a post-hoc
  dump script by session_id was the interim idea).
- **Desired outcome:** `compact_memory` (and eventually the host auto-compaction path)
  dumps the session's FULL pre-compaction content into the session corpus BEFORE the
  compaction runs — so the corpus stays complete even for compacted sessions.
- **Acceptance criteria:** after any compaction of session X via `compact_memory`,
  `.opencode/archive/sessions/<date>_<X>.md` exists and contains the pre-compaction
  messages; the dump runs BEFORE the summarize dispatch; a dump failure does not block
  the compaction (note/WARNING logged); probe stays green (append-only checks).
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/compact_memory.ts` (dump hook before
  summarize); the session-dump script shared with the backfill idea (read-only DB →
  markdown, tool outputs condensed); `.opencode/archive/sessions/`.
- **Status:** **LIVE ACCEPTED 2026-09-17** (direct session
  `ses_f4f539d7cffeVeRhsFQRdoSRUC`, post-restart — the acceptance was the
  session's own self-compact call): `compaction_dumps/ses_f4f539d7cffeVeRhsFQRdoSRUC_c0.md`
  produced with the FULL pre-compaction content (75 messages / 360 parts,
  mode=full, dumped 19:33:00 — BEFORE the summarize landed; the post-dump
  compaction ran clean, COMPACT line in `.opencode/temp/ctx.log` at 21-33,
  gauge back from 84% to 27%). All acceptance criteria met: dump exists,
  pre-compaction messages intact, no-overwrite `_c0` naming, compaction not
  blocked. BUILD LANDED (plan4, 2026-09-15): the hook is in
  `compact_memory.ts` (`preCompactionDump`, fires before ANY dispatch,
  no-overwrite `compaction_dumps/<sid>_c<count>.md` naming), `dump_session.cjs`
  gained `--out`, probe S14 (101-107) green.
   NOTE 2026-09-16 (worker-10, plan7/iter7): node-resolution fix landed (commit
   9fd7557) — the dump hook spawns via `resolveNodeExe()` (the live host's
   execPath is the CLI binary — the wrong spawn failed every dump with a
   WARNING); live acceptance still pending the host restart.
   History: APPROVED + BUILDABLE (maintainer ruling 2026-09-15, direct session:
  "todo 55 can be done and will be activated before the next autorun"); NOTE
  2026-09-15: the corpus `.opencode/archive/sessions/` was backfilled
  (137 sessions).
   NOTE 2026-09-16 (plan1): his approval comment on this entry handled — the
   approval is recorded in the entry history + `priority.md` (#55 approved
   block); the approved follow-up improvements (count-aware dump,
   provider/model fallback, reworded params) are queued in the NAP.

## 54. (closed 2026-09-16, plan8 planner-direct; maintainer call 2026-09-12) — Rule: never circumvent access restrictions; blocked-file protocol for agents

- **Problem / evidence:** worker_Q4_120K (attention-keywords task, 2026-09-12) had no
  edit access to `.opencode/agent/prompts/**` (opencode.jsonc edit-deny) and tried to
  circumvent via bash; task cancelled by the maintainer before anything landed.
- **Desired outcome:** the rule is codified in the role prompts: (1) an agent NEVER
  circumvents access restrictions (no bash/write workarounds around edit-denies);
  (2) when blocked on a file the task needs: do the work as far as possible and note
  the block in `handover_task_to_planner.md`, OR — if the blocked files ARE the main
  body of the work — close the session and report the fact back (no partial hacks).
- **Acceptance criteria:** the rule present in `prompt_agent_task.md` (honesty guard /
  work loop) and in the planner's delegation section; grep-verifiable; zero
  circumvention attempts in subsequent loop logs.
- **Suggested scope:** `prompt_agent_task.md`, `prompt_agent_planner.md`, possibly
  AGENTS.md (maintainer's call — it is his file).
- **Status:** CLOSED (2026-09-16, plan8 planner-direct, approved 2026-09-15) —
  the no-circumvent rule is codified in all three role prompts:
  `prompt_agent_task.md` + `prompt_agent_explorer.md` (§Honesty guard) +
  `prompt_agent_planner.md` (§Delegate vs. do) — grep-verifiable
  (`rg -n circumvent .opencode/agent/prompts/agents/` → 5 hits).

## 65. (closed 2026-09-17, maintainer-ruled — NOT a tool bug, see todo_records.md for the full entry if needed) — loop_log tool folder-detection bug: spurious folders on the maintainer-renamed loop folder (2026-09-16, plan2)
- **Problem / evidence:** the `loop_log` tool did not recognize the
  maintainer-renamed folder `autorun_2-6_0-9_1-6__1-3_3-3` and created TWO
  spurious date-stamped folders in one iteration (autorun-2026-09-16_16-15
  [looprunner INFO], autorun-2026-09-16_17-20 [worker-13 START+DONE]); the
  planner consolidated the lines into the real loop_log.md and deleted the
  folders by hand (twice).
- **Outcome:** folder detection accepts the current loop folder even when its
  name does not match the date pattern (e.g. latest subfolder of
  `.opencode/loop/` carrying a `loop_log.md`; refuse to create a second
  candidate when one already exists).
- **Acceptance:** a `loop_log` call in a renamed folder appends to THAT
  folder's loop_log.md; no spurious folder on the next looprun; probe/smoke
  green.
- **Scope:** `.opencode/tools/loop_log.ts` (+ its smoke if any). Restart-gated.
- **Status:** CLOSED 2026-09-17 (maintainer-ruled, direct session): the cause
  was the maintainer HIMSELF — he had been testing another date format on the
  autorun folder to reduce bitdrift, which the tool's date-pattern detection
  did not recognize. He re-unified both folders into the old date style and
  changed the minute value to remove the previously observed 3→5 bitdrift. No
  tool change needed; the "spurious folder" events were expected behavior on
  a non-matching folder name.

## 51. (closed 2026-09-16, plan8; 2026-09-11, T3 worker flag) — Stale probe header vs `.opencode/package.json` "type" field

- **Problem / evidence:** the probe "WHY THAT COMMAND" block
  (`handover_probe.mjs` ≈28) says `.opencode/package.json` "has no 'type'
  field and must not gain one — that would change the plugin's module
  context", but the file NOW carries `"type": "module"` (+ the
  `@opencode-ai/plugin` dep) — verified 2026-09-11.
- **Outcome (goal):** ruling — is `type: module` the intended current
  state? (header then corrected) or does the constraint still bind (field
  removed)?
- **Acceptance:** header and package.json agree; probe green.
- **Scope:** the probe header (comment), `.opencode/package.json`.
- **Status:** CLOSED (2026-09-16, plan8) — the stale `"type": "module"` field
  removed from `.opencode/package.json` per his ruling; probe header and file now
  agree (the expected `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` warning is the pinned
  post-state, header line ~45); gate green (probe 120+2/120+2 machine-verified
  against the header annotation, pytest 459+1w, ruff F=0, all 7 smokes). Left
  untouched (out of scope for his ruling): the `@opencode-ai/plugin` dep and the
  stale `opencode-context-meter` package name — his call at the next restart if
  opencode says anything.

## 75. (open, 2026-09-21, planner) — **Build our own auto-resume plugin** — unit history (full text moved from TODO.md, 2026-09-23 curation):
the looprunner is a mechanical relay; the maintainer wants infinite direct
planner sessions (his ideas.md item 2026-09-18). Three measured gaps: no
auto-resume after compaction, no auto compaction trigger on context limit, no
auto-restart on `action: restart`. A working reference exists and is
vendored in-repo (opencode-auto-resume v1.1.16, v1-era API surface, verified
compatible with our opencode-ai@1.18.31). — **Desired outcome:** a plugin in
`.opencode/plugin/` that keeps a direct planner session running through
compaction and restart without the looprunner. — **Acceptance criteria:** the
four-unit acceptance list in `proposals/2026-09-21_opencode-auto-resume-plugin.md`
(unit 1 = skeleton logging plugin/testbed; unit 2 = context-limit compaction
trigger; unit 3 = auto-resume after compaction; unit 4 = restart detection +
new planner; each unit leaves the repo green). — **Suggested scope:**
`.opencode/plugin/auto_resume.ts` (new), `knowledge/opencode-plugins/`
(surface report append), the proposal file itself. — Units are independently
approvable, strict build order, unit 1 launchable on approval. **Status 2026-09-21:** Unit 1
LANDED + planner-verified (worker d322927, gate green: smoke 14/14, probe
235/235, pytest 459+1w, ruff F=0); LIVE ACCEPTANCE PASSED same day (post-restart:

Unit 2 LANDED + planner-verified (2026-09-21, plan2, worker
`worker_Q3S_160K` ses_f3b8c19e9ffe2IoV4S9lrx0vSi, code `d90973b`): the
context-limit compaction trigger — queued `promptAsync` self-compact
instruction (`compact_memory` SELF path) at ratio >= 0.85 of the usable
window, once per busy cycle, one 5s tick as the sole gated send funnel
(smoke 32/32 all 7 DoD cases pinned; gate re-verified by the planner:
probe 235/235, pytest 459+1w, ruff F=0). Three spec-vs-reality
discrepancies resolved defensively (SDK `provider.list()` not `get()`;
model pair top-level on the message, not `info.model`; smoke live-log
invariant) — facts cured into the unit-1 surface report §UNIT 2 supplement.
LIVE ACCEPTANCE for Unit 2: the shape bug was FOUND in live acceptance
(the live `session.status` carries `status` as OBJECT `{type}` while
`armEvent` compared strings → zero `arm=`/`saturation=`/`trigger=` lines
in the whole log) and FIXED this commit (`statusOf()` normalization +
dual-shape smoke pin; verdict in the unit-1 surface report
§LIVE ACCEPTANCE supplement). Live re-acceptance PENDING the next host
restart (a live session crossing 85 % must self-compact once per busy
cycle, no re-prefill stall — verified from
`arm=`/`saturation=`/`trigger=` log lines). PARTIAL LIVE VERDICT (plan6,
2026-09-21 post-restart): the `arm=` lines ARE live (6 for the planner
session — the statusOf shape fix works; the trigger side still unproven —
no live session crossed 85 % this looprun; saturation/trigger pending a
natural crossing). Unit 3 LANDED + smoke-verified
(2026-09-21, plan3, worker
`worker_Q3S_160K` ses_f3b555033ffem2gI9qBct1JZwG, the single UNIT 3 commit

spawn helper — the 5s tick (the only decision+send funnel; events stay
ARM-only) checks the one-shot trigger file
`.opencode/temp/auto_resume_spawn_trigger` (same dir as the log); a
present non-empty trigger spawns ONCE (in-flight latch — no double-fire),
then the file is renamed `.consumed` EVEN ON FAILURE (re-trigger = write
a new file); the spawn = `create()` (no args) + ONE QUEUED `promptAsync`
with `agent: "planner_Q3S_160K"` and NO model field (the agent-configured
model applies — the host's opencode.jsonc is the live source of truth,
re-verified at build time: no drift); success → the new sid self-marked
in a module-level `spawned` map (sid → epoch, for Unit 4) + `spawn=`
line; every failure → `spawn-fail=` line, the helper never throws
outward; `create` added to the init surface candidates (the live typeof
verdict is pending for the surface-report supplement). Smoke 39/39 (32
existing + 7 new UNIT 3 checks; surface pin updated to carry create);
gate: probe 235/235 UNCHANGED, pytest 459+1w, ruff F=0 (one pre-existing

smoke-verified (2026-09-21, plan4, worker-5 `worker_Q3S_160K`
ses_f3af705fdffeRiYr9H7FflN0o7): the planner liveness watchdog — a

going idle / `session.error` is routed on the next tick by the LAST

 the proposal lines 138-142). NOTE: unit numbering
 per the revised proposal — Unit 3 = new-planner spawn helper (shared

 compaction is its first branch); the "unit 3 = auto-resume / unit 4 =
 restart detection" wording above is the pre-revision numbering.

## 2026-09-23 (plan10, planner-10) — full text of closed entries #68, #69, #71, #73 and #79 (moved from TODO.md; #68/#69/#71/#73 deferred from the 2026-09-23_02-51 curation, #79 closed by the plan10 live acceptance):

## 68. (CLOSED 2026-09-16 — R2 approved + landed) — Write-scope fuzzy (step 2 of the Q3 roadmap)
- **Problem / evidence:** maintainer ruling (addendum Q3, 2026-09-16): read
  AND write scope, one step after the other — "too useful to degrade to
  observer permanently". Write-scope needs the mutation-channel verdict
  (#66) AND its own approval (write-scope fuzzy on edit/write/delete is a
  data-loss hazard per research §2.3 — the existence-gate + correction-log
  discipline of §4.2 must be specced).
- **Outcome:** spec for write-scope resolution (scope rule, existence gate,
  correction log, fail-closed) → maintainer approval → build.
- **Acceptance:** approved spec + landed build + gate green (per spec).
- **Scope:** research doc §2.3/§3.4/§4.2 as the design source; staged spec
  `research/fuzzy-numword/spec_R2_write_scope.md`.
- **Status:** CLOSED 2026-09-16 — approved ("R2 approved") + build landed
 GREEN (35f8143: probe 206/206 S20, smoke 35/35 8f, pytest 459, ruff
 clean); acceptance met per spec. Deviation accepted: ref gate =
 `for-each-ref` membership (rev-parse 40-hex ambiguity measured,
 decision-record §5). **ONE-SHOT ACCEPTANCE MET 2026-09-17** (direct
 session, post-restart): write-scope LIVE — benign mistype corrected
 (`file-for→file-four d=1 gap=2`) AND the #72 hazard live-measured
 (`file-5→file-4 d=1 gap=3` hijack); display finding: tool results show
 the POST-MUTATION path (log field 5 = sole authority — decision-record
 §5 R2). Residual hazard → #72 (M1 ruling recorded).

## 69. (CLOSED 2026-09-16 — AGENTS.md paste, acceptance fully met) — Redundancy form codification: `[left:right]` (SUPERSEDES the `<4|four>` Q2 form)
- **Problem / evidence:** the addendum Q2 form `<4|four>` (angle brackets +
  pipe) was REJECTED by measurement 2026-09-16 (direct session): unquoted
  in Git-Bash, `<...>` = syntax error (exit 2) and `|` = pipe break (exit
 127) — both measured; `[left:right]` survives (exit 0) with one known
  glob edge (single-char cwd file) mitigated by a quote-when-bash rule.
  Full table + reasoning: `research/fuzzy-numword/decision-record.md` §2.4.
  His FB grammar comments (`<8-6-1>` fallback, adder-left `[800+50+11:…]`,
  right-wins, "to be discussed in direct session") were DISCUSSED and
  ruled: single-digit dash form recommended, full map = accepted fallback,
  pair-left ∈ {as-seen | adder | numword}, right = numword, right-wins.
- **Outcome:** codify the convention where it survives compaction of ANY
  agent: (a) AGENTS.md — maintainer PASTE (draft in decision-record §4,
  his action); (b) the observer form switch + read-scope resolution =
  spec_R1 (launch-ready); (c) role-prompt pointer lines (planner-direct or
  planner-as-text-worker, after R1 — worker edit-deny on prompts/).
- **Acceptance:** his AGENTS.md paste landed + R1 green + pointer lines in
  planner/worker/looprunner prompts.
- **Scope:** AGENTS.md (maintainer), spec_R1 build, `prompt_agent_*.md`
  pointer lines.
- **Status:** CLOSED 2026-09-16 — acceptance fully met: AGENTS.md paste
  landed (bf18f14); R1 GREEN (96bb173, probe 193/193); pointer lines in
  planner+worker prompt index (3e0406c). NOTE: ALL FB-file comments are
  acted on and recorded in the decision record (§6.5) — do not re-act the
  `--comment` markers there (they are his input record).

## 71. (CLOSED 2026-09-17, planner-direct) — Stale probe totals in repo_commands.md (maintainer file)
- **Problem / evidence:** `repo_commands.md` §Run/test still quotes "~376"
  and "one hundred twenty-two (plan7…)" — mutually inconsistent stale
  numbers; the declared source (the probe's self-annotation) is 180/180
  (plan2). Worker-13 flagged; the file is maintainer-maintained (agents do
  not edit the repo parts directly).
- **Outcome:** refresh the section to the curate-don't-duplicate pointer
  (per #64 convention: point at the self-annotation, no moving number).
- **Acceptance:** section reads the pointer; no duplicated total.
- **Scope:** `repo_commands.md` §Run/test (maintainer or an explicitly
  tasked agent).
- **Status:** CLOSED (2026-09-17, planner-direct — maintainer ruled the
  planner is allowed to update this file): §Run/test now carries the
  curate-don't-duplicate pointer (no duplicated moving number at all — the
  probe's self-annotation is the sole source), per the #58/#64 convention.

## #73. (LANDED 2026-09-17, planner-verified) — R7 realistic doubled case: the segment channel's gap rule fails

## when the target's parent DIR is a corpus entry (measured 09-17)
- **Problem + evidence:** the shipped R7 (ee19a84; gates 216/216 + 37/37
 green) does NOT resolve the realistic nested doubling. Repro
 (scratchpad `r7_realistic_repro.mjs`, still there): repo
 `Projects/OpenCodeProjects/{Free-Snap-Tap/TODO.md, SiblingProj/…}` +
 doubled arg `…/OpenCodeProjects/OpenCodeProjects/Free-Snap-Tap/TODO.md`
 → `fuzzy-rejected` for read AND edit. Root cause: the corpus (built
 from the nearest existing ancestor) contains the target's parent DIR
 entry at seg-d=2; the target sits at seg-d=1 → gap 1 <
 FUZZY_MIN_GAP=2 → `gap-too-small`. S21 pins 210/211 pass only because
 their fixture corpus is FLAT files (second-best at seg-d=3) — the
 pin-fixture design gap is the planner's (spec'd the shapes, not the
 corpus realism).
- **Desired outcome:** the doubled-folder case (the maintainer's most
 observed error) resolves at hook level in a real nested repo.
- **Design (planner 09-17):** a STRUCTURAL pre-check before corpus
 matching in `runFuzzyRead`/`runFuzzyWrite`: if the arg's segments
 contain an adjacent identical pair (case-insensitive), collapse one
 copy; the collapsed path must EXIST (strict gate, no corpus, no gap
 rule) → resolve; else fail-closed and fall through to the existing
 matchers. Verdict reuses `fuzzy-resolved` with a `kind=dedup` evidence
 flag (9-verdict vocabulary untouched; `write` stays M1-excluded).
 S21 gains the REALISTIC nested fixture pin (parent-dir corpus entry +
 sibling project) for read + edit + write-zero-lines.
- **Acceptance:** the 3 repro cases behave per the design (read/edit
 resolved, write zero lines); new S21 realistic pin green; full gate
 green; repro torn down.
- **Suggested scope:** `intercept_observer_core.ts` (the collapse
 helper), `intercept_observer.ts` (pre-check in both fuzzy runners),
 the S21 section.
- **Status:** LANDED + planner-verified (2026-09-17, ses_f510a…, code
 dce82ad, bookkeeping 9c701ed): the `collapseAdjacentDup` existence-gated
 pre-check in `runFuzzyRead`/`runFuzzyWrite` (BEFORE the seg/char matchers)
 resolves the realistic nested doubling with a `kind=dedup` evidence line
 (d=0, no gap); a doubled `write` stays ZERO lines (M1 extends to the dedup).
 Gate: probe two-one-six → two-two-zero (216), smoke 37/37, pytest 459+1w,
 ruff F=0; S21 8 → 12 (re-pins 210/211 + smoke 8g to kind=dedup, 4 new pins
 218 read / 219 edit / 220 collapse-target-absent stays rejected / 21 write
 zero-lines + realistic-nested fixture). Repro torn down. **LIVE ACCEPTED
 (2026-09-17, ses_f4f539d7c… post-restart one-shot, scratchpad fixture, torn
 down):** doubled nested `read` resolved `kind=dedup scope=read d=0` (log
 `orig=` doubled → corrected, file content returned); doubled `edit` resolved
 `kind=dedup scope=write d=0` (applied to the real file). Doubled `write`
 NOT live-proven via the planner's own emission — 5/5 attempts collapsed the
 doubled segment at emission (log-verified `orig=` single each time; the
 single writes landed literal + zero lines, M1 guard held). Hook-level
 doubled-write coverage stands on pins 21/218–220 (same runner as the
 live-proven edit path — the guard is the shared dispatch condition).
 Emission data point: the collapse bias is STRONGEST on write calls
 (read doubled 1st try, edit 3rd, write 5/5 collapsed).

## 79. (open — LANDED 2026-09-22, live acceptance pending; 2026-09-21, planner; HIGH — live, measured) — auto_resume Unit 4 `msgPairs` never unwraps the SDK `{ data }` wrapper → action lines are NEVER recognized (spurious recovery prompts / context drain)
- **Problem / evidence (measured live, plan6, 2026-09-21):** after closing TWO consecutive turns each ending in a valid `action: restart`, `auto_resume.log` shows two `recovery= … attempt=1` lines (the counter RESET between them — `armEvent` busy resets `recoveryCount` at line 679 on every busy cycle) and `route=` count = **0** across the whole looprun — i.e. NO action line was ever recognized.
- **Root cause:** `auto_resume.ts` line 492 `msgPairs(msgs) = Array.isArray(msgs) ? msgs : []`. But `sess.messages()` (line 567) returns the SDK `RequestResult` wrapper `{ data: [...] }`, never a bare array — so `msgPairs` always returns `[]` → `lastAssistantAction` (line 518) always returns null → `userHasMarker` (line 505) always returns false. **Same root cause as the `compact_memory` `resolveModel` bug fixed in 280b8d0 — NOT covered in auto_resume.**
- **Consequence:** Unit 4 can never read restart/resume/stop/ask_maintainer → always the recovery branch; since `recoveryCount` resets on every busy cycle, the cap (2) is never reached → a FINISHED session gets re-woken with spurious recovery prompts (context drain). The loop itself still progresses via the **looprunner** (a separate mechanism with correct parsing) — the auto-resume plugin's own routing is broken.
- **Desired outcome:** the messages-RPC result is unwrapped (bare array + `{ data }` wrapper) at the single `msgPairs` site, so Unit 4 routing reads action lines correctly: stop/ask → no send (`route= stop|ask`); resume/null → bounded recovery; restart → `route= restart spawn`.
- **Acceptance:** a planner closing `action: restart` produces `route= restart spawn` (not a recovery prompt); `action: stop` → `route= stop`, no send; a smoke case pins the wrapper shape; standard gate green (smoke + probe + pytest + ruff).
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/auto_resume.ts` (`msgPairs` line 492 — the single consumer fix; verify no other messages-RPC site), `.opencode/plugin/tests/auto_resume.smoke.mjs` (add a wrapper-shape case), probe pins.
  - **Status:** LANDED + planner-verified (2026-09-22, plan7, worker-11

    v=24972ebd, 13:00:08Z on v=d2b9d510), no recovery= lines for the sid.

## 2026-09-23 (plan11, worker `worker_Q3S_170K`) — full text of closed entry #87 (subsumed by #90, moved from TODO.md):

## #87. (open — maintainer call) — Unit-4 cannot revive a dead self-spawned successor: the plugin-driven loop stalls (finding 2026-09-23, planner-8)
- **Problem + evidence:** `scopeVerdict`'s FIRST check is the `spawned`
  self-mark (`auto_resume.ts` L754; set in `spawnPlanner` L612; NO
  clear/expiration path) → any session the plugin spawned itself
  (Unit-3/4 `spawnPlanner`) is scope "none" — never recovered, never
  restart-spawned (#85 part-1 loop-prevention: "a freshly-spawned
  successor must not be re-triggered"). Measured live (2026-09-23):
  planner-8's session (ses_f33f1eb98ffeFvrnTdmTzmyE2x) was spawned by the
  Unit-4 RESTART branch (log `spawn=` 02:17:49Z; its first user message
  is the locked restartText); it went idle 3× — once after a self-
  compaction close WITHOUT an action line — and the plugin never routed
  it (log: `scope= none` 03:00:03Z; no `recovery=`/`route=` lines for the
  sid). Consequence: the L3 self-compaction continue protocol ("the
  looprunner RESUMEs via task_id") has no live looprunner in
  plugin-driven mode — only a maintainer message rescued the session.
  NOTE: a toggle in a maintainer message (`<|Autorun|>`) does NOT re-scope
  a self-spawned session (the spawned check precedes the toggle check).
- **Desired outcome:** his ruling on dead-successor semantics (options
  below); then spec + landing.
- **Options (his ruling):** (a) keep the stall — a dead loop is visible,
  he restarts (no code); (b) bounded restart-spawn of a dead self-spawned
  successor (e.g. ONE re-spawn per successor, or only if the session made
  a committed progress since spawn — preserving #85's loop prevention);
  (c) keep the looprunner in the loop after a plugin spawn (hand off to
  the looprunner instead of self-spawning — it already has
  resume-from-death semantics); (d) re-arm on a fresh busy after
  compaction (clear the spawned mark on the self-spawned session's first
  busy — revives L3 continuation; risks the #85 loop unless bounded).
- **Acceptance:** ruling recorded; spec written; the behavior change is
  approved BEFORE implementation (observable behavior).
- **Status:** open — maintainer call (he is AFK; recorded for the next
  direct session).
- **Closed:** 2026-09-23 — SUBSUMED by #90 (the approved proposal, Parts
  A+B+C). Part A removes the `spawned` exclusion so the self-spawned
  successor is now TRACKED (its first user message is the RESTART prompt,
  line 1 = the exact own-line toggle → scope "autorun") and is RECOVERED
  after an idle without an action line (the #87 stall case, inverted);
  option (b)'s "committed progress" idea is replaced by the LINEAGE-DEPTH
  cap (N=2) on the spawn branch. Options (a)/(c)/(d) are superseded.

## 80. (open — fix LANDED 2026-09-22 + plugin reactivated, live acceptance (b) verified, close pending maintainer confirm; 2026-09-22, planner; HIGH) auto_resume inject calls lose the session agent → turns run as "build"
- **Problem + evidence:** the Unit 2 (L387) + Unit 4 (L643) `promptAsync`
  calls in `.opencode/plugin/deactivated/auto_resume.ts` send NO `agent`
  field (the Unit 3 spawn does, L432). opencode's prompt path defaults a
  missing agent to "build" → the injected turn runs as Build (DB, 2026-09-22
  direct session ses_f39d250e9ffeheip2FVEeY5Fk6: injected user msgs + the
  following assistant turns carry agent=build/mode=build, 23:58 ×4;
  planner-6's session record agent=build). Impact: per-injected-turn
  system-prompt change → whole prompt-cache invalidation + the planner loses
  its system prompt (the planner-worker workflow is broken for those turns).
- **Related open anomaly:** unit 4 acted on a direct (non-autorun) session
  despite the scope=none fail-safe (5× `recovery= attempt=1`; the cap resets
  on each injected busy → unreachable as-is). NO user text part of that
  session carries `<|autonom|>` (all 15 checked) and the spawned map never
  held it. Maintainer 2026-09-22: the 5 injections = his 4 interrupt
  attempts + 1 initial — he tried to interrupt 4 times, then exited
  opencode; NO scope-logic edits. The scope verdict is single (L614:
  `spawned.has` || `userHasMarker`; the spawned-map population path is
  untraced — likely a Map) → verify at fix time. Resolve before
  re-activation (suggested: a version hash in the `surface=` line).
- **Desired outcome:** injected messages preserve the session's agent (cache
  warm, role prompt intact); a direct session ends idle untouched.
- **Acceptance criteria:** (a) the unit 2/4 `promptAsync` body carries an
  explicit agent — scoped sessions: the spawn-side `PLANNER_AGENT_ID`; other
  sessions: the first user message's agent from the existing `messages()`
  fetch (`session.agent` is UNRELIABLE — it tracks the LAST prompt; proven
  lock-in to "build" on planner-6); (b) live (post re-activation): the
  injected message + turn show the session's original agent in the DB and
  cache-read tokens stay high (no full re-prefill); (c) a direct session ends
  idle with no recovery/trigger injection.
- **Open design questions (maintainer, undecided):** recovery-cap semantics
  (reset-on-busy makes the cap unreachable while the plugin keeps injecting);
  direct session = new "autorun" entry with direct interaction (his
  stop/interrupt + `ask_maintainer` must stop the loop — NEW (his idea
  2026-09-22): an `ask_maintainer` timer, e.g. 5 min — if he is not
  available, the loop/autorun resumes after the timeout); planner
  compaction budget exhaustion (keep=0 + same-session resume + budget reset
  vs. higher cap — bit-rot risk).
- **Status:** implementation LANDED (4098253, worker-2
  ses_f371e0e23ffe0eza71uD5qWy7K); plugin REACTIVATED 2026-09-22
  (380e326) — live gen `surface= v=0bb5c46f` hash-verified byte-identical
  to the #80-fixed build; **(b) VERIFIED LIVE 2026-09-22 12:33:18Z
  (DB): both the unit-2 + unit-4 injections carry
  agent=planner_Q3S_160K (pre-fix behavior: agent=build) and the
  following assistant turn does too — injected turns keep the session
  agent; (c) now gated on #82 (his marker-quote message flipped the
  scope live — a design gap, not a fix failure); close pending his
  confirm. Gate note: probe 240/241 — check [97] pre-existing red
  (maintainer temp fix 0f192e5) → #81. **Close ruling 2026-09-23 (planner-12 direct): close YES once #91 + #82 have landed** (his reply to the confirm request). (c) live evidence now also covers the post-#90 build: the Direct session ses_f3144d9d6… was judged scope=none at 17:08:57Z and went idle untouched (zero recovery/route/spawn lines) under the new build ef8c6149.
  History: investigated 2026-09-22
  (planner, direct session); FIX DESIGN APPROVED by the maintainer
  2026-09-22; plugin DEACTIVATED (a000dfd). Item-3 scope anomaly: H1
  REFUTED 2026-09-22 (DB check — none of the session's 44 user-role parts,
  every part type, contains `<|autonom|>`); H2 (running variant ≠ committed
  file) leading; the new `scope=` verdict log line + `surface=` v= version
  ID will pin verdict + code state on the next incident.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/deactivated/auto_resume.ts` (L387,
  L643; scope scan L543-551).
- **Closed:** 2026-09-23 — maintainer confirm (planner-12 direct session: "close YES once #91 + #82 have landed"); both landed (#91: 2fa4bb6; #82's unit-2 part = the already-landed #85 p3 Direct-gate behavior, his ruling recorded in #82). (c) live-verified under the post-#90 build (the Direct session idle-untouched, scope=none 17:08:57Z).

## 81. (open — re-pin LANDED 2026-09-22 (af38e2f), gate green; maintainer call — close pending his confirm; 2026-09-22, worker-2 via inbox) probe [97] + compact_memory smoke pin red since temp fix 0f192e5
- **Problem + evidence:** `handover_probe.mjs` check [97] (unit A: "exactly
  ONE queued promptAsync carrying the text part") and the matching
  `compact_memory.smoke.mjs` message pin FAIL at HEAD (probe 240/241, only
  [97] red; the smoke: 1 FAIL, everything else pass). Pre-existing — NOT
  the #80 work (the probe does not load auto_resume.ts): the maintainer's
  temp fix `0f192e5` (2026-09-22) commented out the `promptAsync` call in
  `compact_memory.ts` `queueMessage` (to stop the queued-message race — the
  SELF compaction incident); the pins still expect the pre-fix behavior.
- **Desired outcome:** the gate green again — either re-pin probe [97] +
  the smoke to the temp-fix behavior (no queued promptAsync; the queued-note
  line is still emitted), or re-pin them when the compact_memory message
  feature gets its proper fix.
- **Acceptance criteria:** probe 241/241 + `compact_memory.smoke.mjs`
  green; TODO #80's live acceptance then re-runnable against a full-green
  gate.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs` (check
  [97]), `.opencode/plugin/tests/compact_memory.smoke.mjs`;
  `compact_memory.ts` only if the message path is restored.
- **Status:** LANDED 2026-09-22 (af38e2f, worker_Q3S_160K — the planner records

## 53. Agent-feedback protocol: mandatory close-down step + small write-tool (DEFERRED 2026-09-12, **DEFERRAL LIFTED 2026-09-17** — direct session; maintainer: "it did not even know anymore that i deferred it") — the optional `agent_feedback.md` entries get discarded by the early-close-at-stop-line discipline; make it a NON-optional part of the close-down phase (directly before the closing message), full date_time on each entry, and a small tool that writes the entry (no file fiddling / accidental reads). **Proposal FILED 2026-09-17** (`proposals/2026-09-17_agent-feedback-closedown.md` —
Part A: mandatory close-down prompt step, full date_time auto-stamped; Part B:
unified `submit` tool per his #5 sketch; recommendation: both as one unit)
— **ruled 2026-09-17: approved both parts in one unit**.
**Status 2026-09-18 (plan1, looprun 2026-09-17_23-58):** Part A LANDED

## 66. 5.3+5.4 restart acceptance (open — PENDING RESTART, 2026-09-16 direct session)
- **Problem / evidence:** the observer plugin failed to LOAD on the first
  live check ("Plugin export is not a function" — fixed by the core split,
  `4719cc5`); the read-scope mutation channel (5.4 one-shot) is still
  unproven. No `.opencode/temp/intercept.log` exists yet.
- **Outcome:** at the next restart: (1) first `intercept.log` lines appear
  (dense/numword/dense-date triggers — any session with dense args);
  (2) the mutation-channel verdict: read the scratchpad sentinel
  `C:/Users/Wasiejen/AppData/Local/Temp/opencode/fuzzy_accept/file-four.txt`
  via a d<=2 mistyped path → if the tool result is the TWIN content
  (`file-4.txt`) AND a `fuzzy-resolved` line is logged → mutation channel
  LIVE (write-scope #68 unblocked); else NOT live (5.3 stays log-only,
  redundancy-naming route #69 becomes primary). Record the verdict in
  TODO + the research doc; then tear down the sentinel per §5.4.
- **Acceptance:** verdict line in TODO.md + one line in the research doc
  dated section; fixture state noted.
- **Scope:** none (read the log + one controlled read) — planner at the
  restart.
- **Status:** PENDING RESTART (stale — resolved by #68's live acceptance 2026-09-17).
- **Closed:** 2026-09-23 (planner-13) — the read-scope mutation channel was proven LIVE by #68's one-shot live-acceptance (benign mistype corrected + `fuzzy-resolved` logged); the §5.4 sentinel torn down (the scratchpad `fuzzy_accept/` folder no longer exists); intercept.log accumulated to 3076 lines / 139 sessions by 2026-09-23 — full text to todo_records.md.

## 82. (open — scope-toggle LANDED 2026-09-22 via #85 part 1; live acceptance + unit-2 suppression question pending; 2026-09-22, planner live; HIGH) scope verdict: last-toggle-wins over user history, own-line anchor, bidirectional (on/off markers)
- **Problem + evidence:** live incident 2026-09-22T12:33:18Z (gen
  v=0bb5c46f — the verified #80-fixed build, post-380e326 re-activation):
  unit 4 injected a recovery prompt into the direct (no-launch) session
  ses_f39d250e9ffeheip2FVEeY5Fk6. Log: `scope= planner sid=…` →
  `recovery= attempt=1` → `arm= … injected` (the cap fix worked — the
  injected busy was consumed, no reset). CAUSE identified live: the
  maintainer's clarifying-question message contained the literal
  `<|autonom|>` (a user text part) — `userHasMarker` scans ALL user
  parts, so any later user message quoting the marker flips a direct
  session to scope=planner. (The original 2026-09-21 incident — 9×
  recovery with NO user marker in history at the time — remains H2,
  runtime-shape, unresolved.)
- **Desired outcome (his ruling 2026-09-22 — SUPERSEDES the
  first-message-only proposal):** scope is re-evaluated on EVERY new
  user message — LAST TOGGLE WINS over the user history (restart-safe:
  the same scan derives the state after a process restart). Toggle
  markers count ONLY on their own line (message-start anchors ruled
  out — the injected `ctx:` gauge line always prefixes the message, so
   the marker never sits at the start). ON: `<|autonom|>` (the existing
   launch marker) AND `<|Autorun|>` — CONFIRMED 2026-09-22: both count as
   ON, CASE-INSENSITIVE (his original german wordplay was `autonom`; both
   spellings stick); OFF: `<|Direct|>` (case-insensitive). Bidirectional:
   he can deactivate AND reactivate mid-session without starting a new
   session (context preservation — his stated motivation).
- **Acceptance criteria:** own-line match only (mid-sentence or
  bullet-prefixed markers never toggle); smoke: (i) mid-sentence quote
  → scope unchanged; (ii) own-line `<|Direct|>` then own-line
  `<|autonom|>` → last wins (ON); (iii) restart derives the same state
  from history (no in-memory persistence). Live: his post-restart test
  on this session — under the CURRENT code (all-parts scan) autorun WILL
  re-engage (any quote counts); after #82 it must NOT (his message
  carries no own-line toggle). `route= stop` live-proven by this
  session's `action: stop` turns (#70 residue). OPEN (his call, after
  the 85%-trigger info given 2026-09-22): does OFF also suppress unit 2
  (context trigger) or only unit 4?
- **Suggested scope:** `userHasMarker` / scope verdict in
  `.opencode/plugin/auto_resume.ts` (L614, L543-551) + smoke section.
 - **Status:** design AGREED 2026-09-22 (his ruling on all open
   questions); the SCOPE-TOGGLE portion LANDED as part of #85 part 1
   (2026-09-22, worker worker_Q3S_170K — the last-toggle-wins own-line
   evaluation is in the auto_resume.ts scope verdict, and the smoke pins
   acceptance (i) mid-sentence quote, (ii) last-toggle-wins ON, plus the
   own-line/trim + case-insensitive rules and the restart-safe derivation);
   remaining: live acceptance (his post-restart test) + the unit-2-
   suppression question (his call after the 85%-trigger info). **Unit-2 suppression RULING 2026-09-23 (planner-12 direct): YES — Direct suppresses Unit 2** (his rationale: otherwise he would toggle autoCompact off in compact_budget.json and forget to re-enable it). That is ALREADY the landed behavior since #85 part 3 (the onToolAfterNudge verdict-none gate — the passive ctx-line nudge is Direct-gated; NO code change needed). Live evidence 2026-09-23: the Direct session ses_f3144d9d6… judged scope=none (17:08:57Z), idle-untouched under the post-#90 build. Remaining: the full post-restart live acceptance rides the #90 new-build spawn tail (the restartText line-1 own-line marker as a spawned successor's first message) — DONE 2026-09-23 (planner-13).
- **Closed:** 2026-09-23 (planner-13) — FULL live acceptance on the #90 spawn tail (build v=7d2e6207): the own-line `<|autonom|>` toggle judged `scope= autorun` (19:20:54Z) then `route= restart spawn` (19:20:55Z) then the successor's first message carries the exact own-line marker (the restartText line 1) + `deactivate=` on the trigger (idle-untouched afterwards); the unit-2 suppression ruling (Direct suppresses Unit 2) = the already-landed #85 part 3 behavior (no code change) — full text to todo_records.md.

## #90. (LANDED 2026-09-23, worker `worker_Q3S_170K`) - plugin-spawned successors inherit the trigger's Autorun state + the trigger deactivates (approved proposal Parts A+B+C): (A) the `spawned` self-mark EXCLUSION removed from `scopeVerdict` (now a 1-arg function of the messages only), the `spawned` map REPURPOSED as the LINEAGE-DEPTH map (sid→depth), `restartText()` LINE 1 = the exact own-line `<|autonom|>` (prose moved to line 2) so every restart-spawned successor derives scope "autorun" from its first user message ALONE (restart-safe — no in-memory state), and a LINEAGE-DEPTH CAP (N=2) on the restart/cap-exhaustion spawn branch REPLACES the #85 exclusion's loop guard (`skip= depth sid=` at depth≥2; a file-trigger spawn stays depth 0); (B) `spawnPlanner` RETURNS the new sid (null on every failure path — the `spawn-fail=` lines are unchanged), a SUCCESSFUL spawn STICKY-deactivates the TRIGGER (`deactivate= sid=` line; a failed spawn changes nothing) and `routeScopedIdle` skips the deactivated trigger right after the scope recompute (`skip= deactivated sid=` — no send, no re-spawn, the session stays manually usable); the flag records the trigger's user-message count at deactivation and clears ONLY on a NEW user message carrying an own-line ON toggle; (C) at init (the factory call) the plugin RESTORES the in-memory depth map + deactivation flags from its own `auto_resume.log` (each `route= restart spawn sid=X` line paired with the following `spawn= sid=Y` → deactivated(X) + depth(Y)=depth(X)+1; an unpaired `spawn=` → depth 0; once per process). Smoke re-pinned: auto_resume.smoke.mjs 118/118 (the old #85 spawned-exclusion pins flipped to the new behavior + the proposal's acceptance pins 1-7 added). Gate green: probe 241/241, all 10 smokes, pytest 459 passed + 1 warning, ruff F=0. SUBSUMES #87 (now closed). Commit **c4b244d** (planner-verified 2026-09-23: independent smoke re-run 118/118).
   **Live acceptance (2026-09-23, planner-12 direct ses_f3144d9d6…, post-restart):** the live build v=ef8c6149 IS the #90 build (sha256 prefix of the on-disk auto_resume.ts = the surface= v= line; process starts 16:32:37Z + 16:37:45Z, both after c4b244d 15:53:06Z). PART A verified by A/B contrast on the SAME successor session — the old build (d2b9d510) judged it scope=none (14:46:16Z, the spawn exclusion) vs the new build scope=autorun (16:37:07Z) + recovery= attempt=1 (the #87 stall case INVERTED: the successor is tracked + recoverable; the cap held at attempt=1). PART B/C verified — the new process's init log-restore (the old route= + spawn= pair) → zero re-routing/spawn against the trigger (planner-11) after the restart + zero spawn= lines in the new process (no unbounded loop; the trigger's own final close was correctly route= stop at 15:59:27Z under the old process). NOT YET exercised live by the new build: its own restart spawn (the deactivate= line on success, the new restartText line-1 exact-own-line marker as the successor's first message, the depth-cap skip=) — awaits the next autorun action:restart close. ADJACENT LIVE FINDING → TODO #91 (the compaction summary leaked into the spawn identity + routing during the 14:46Z episode — STILL LATENT in the live build).

ALL THREE previously unexercised items verified live: (1) the `deactivate=` line on success + the trigger idle-untouched afterwards (zero scope=/route=/recovery= for its sid post-spawn); (2) the new restartText line-1 exact own-line `<|autonom|>` as the successor's first user message (line 1 of the queued text; line 2 of the received message after the gauge's passive `ctx:` prefix per #85 part 3); (3) zero `skip=` depth-cap lines. The successor was armed (arm= lines from 19:20:55Z); its own `scope= autorun` line appears in the log at its first idle evaluation (after that session's close).

## #96. (open, 2026-09-25, planner-14; his launch directive — auto_resume.log hardware wear) auto_resume.log write-volume reduction
- **Problem / evidence:** `.opencode/temp/auto_resume.log` = 239.6MB /
  2,813,277 lines at ~4 days process uptime (measured 2026-09-25):
  **97.4% of the bytes = `event=message.part.delta` lines** (2,718,066
  lines / 231.0MB) — the event hook `onEvent` (auto_resume.ts
  L1468-1480) logs ONE line per event, incl. every streamed token
  delta; the current process (v=c57de2cc) wrote ≈18.7k delta lines in
  ~20 min ≈ 1.25M lines/day ≈ ~100MB/day of small appends (his SSD-
  wear concern). The remaining lines grow ≈1MB/day. The old-build
  lines `skip= autoCompact-off` / `saturation=` are NOT emitted by the
  current source (grep-clean) — no work needed there.
- **Desired outcome:** the log stops growing per-token; a size guard
  bounds long-term growth; the existing 233MB file is trimmed
  AUTOMATICALLY on the next host restart (no manual step).
- **Design (planner, 2026-09-25 — the spec at launch is built from this
  entry):** (1) `onEvent` NEVER logs `message.part.delta` (the arm path
  is unaffected — the Unit-2 saturation input is `message.updated`
  only, L1447-1464); all other event types unchanged. (2) Size guard
  at init, BEFORE `restoreLineageFromLog` (L1508-1544 — today it reads
  the whole 233MB): log size > 20MB → keep the byte TAIL (last 2MB),
  ONE `log-trim= old=<bytes> new=<bytes>` line; caps as factory options
  (defaults 20MB/2MB; small values in the smoke — the `tickMs` factory-
  option pattern L1573-1574); absent/unreadable → no-op. `log()` is a
  per-line appendFileSync (L352-359) → the file is never held open → a
  synchronous init-trim is safe. Documented accepted consequence: the
  #90 lineage restore sees only the surviving tail (an older
  route=/spawn= pair cut by the trim → depth resets to 0 — best-effort
  by design). (3) Smoke re-pins (baseline 129/129): a synthetic
  `message.part.delta` event → zero log lines for it (a paired
  `message.updated` in the same batch still logs); a seeded oversized
  log → trim + tail preserved + the `log-trim=` line; the lineage
  restore still works on a trimmed tail.
- **Acceptance:** zero `message.part.delta` lines appended after a
  live restart (his live check); the 233MB file trimmed to ~2MB on the
  next restart with the `log-trim=` line; smoke + standard gate green.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/auto_resume.ts` (`onEvent`,
  init, the trim guard), `.opencode/plugin/tests/auto_resume.smoke.mjs`.
- **Status:** CODE LANDED (worker-Q3S-170K, 2026-09-25, commits
  22c36e4 + 70399ea): the delta exclusion + the init size guard
  (defaults 20MB/2MB, factory options `maxLogBytes`/`logTailBytes`) +
  the smoke re-pins (133/133; standard gate green: probe 279/279,
  pytest 459 passed + 1 warning, ruff F=0). PENDING his live check at
  the next host restart: zero `message.part.delta` lines appended from
  the new build + the existing file (239.6MB at measure, ~100MB/day
  growth — 264.4MB at worker run) trimmed to ~2MB with the `log-trim=`
  line — then close.
- **Closed:** 2026-09-25 (planner-17) — live-verified post-restart this session: the init trim fired (`log-trim= old=293026007 new=2097152`, 12:50:57Z — 293MB → 2MB) and zero `message.part.delta` lines were appended after the trim (last delta line 24391 < trim line 24434; the new build's ~2.7k lines are delta-free) — acceptance met, closed.

## #93. (closed 2026-09-27, direct session ses_f20d1b39… — live-verified by his repeated overflow tests 2026-09-26/27: the recovery fires on overflow, compacts, and does NOT resume (the unification Part B behavior — correct), the session continues; budget counter 1 increment (Gemma ses_f20e63e08); the event-hook port LANDED 2026-09-25; the one-plugin integration follow-up LANDED 2026-09-26 plan23 unification) — Emergency compact backstop: port context_recovery.ts to the `event` hook

- **Problem / evidence:** context_recovery.ts (the T5 emergency overflow recovery — the backstop for when the agent fails to self-compact in time) registers a `"session.error"` plugin hook that does NOT exist in the current `@opencode-ai/plugin` SDK (zero matches in the node_modules d.ts) → the hook never fires (silent). Live fork test 2026-09-23 (ses_f2fee1f3fffej3GlGz8jJ5iGwb "compaction agent and context limit testing", fork of planner-13, Qwen3.8-27B-Compaction): 4× overflow errors `request (148149 tokens) exceeds the available context size (131072 tokens)` reached the event stream with `emergencyRecovery: true` ON + the plugin loaded — no COMPACT line, no budget increment, the session died at the wall (`MessageAbortedError`).
- **Outcome:** the backstop fires on an overflow session.error (compact with the configured keep → COMPACT line → reload directive → `{handled:true, action:"retry"}`) + a diagnostic line on EVERY fire (so a future silent failure is visible in one file).
- **Acceptance:** live overflow on a driven/forked session → COMPACT line + budget increment + the session retries and continues (log evidence); smoke pin for the event-hook path (extend the existing probe's faked client to the event shape); standard gate green.
- **Scope:** `.opencode/plugin/deactivated/context_recovery.ts` → `event` hook (`event.properties.sessionID` — capital D — + the `ContextOverflowError` union); flag/budget/keep/COMPACT/directive logic unchanged; move back to `.opencode/plugin/` at landing. PRESTEP to the maintainer's planned integration of context_recovery + compact_memory into ONE plugin (shared compaction functionality) — the integration itself is a separate follow-up task.
- **Status:** LANDED 2026-09-25 (worker, `worker_Q3S_170K`): the event-hook port lives at `.opencode/plugin/context_recovery.ts` (the deactivated copy is removed) — `event` hook (no `"session.error":` key — that hook does not exist in the current SDK), capital-D `sessionID`, the overflow markers, the v1 summarize path with the config-resolved pair (self-contained local copies — no runtime import from compact_memory.ts), the v2 budget gate (normal / emergency-1 / exhausted CLEAN FAIL), the once-per-overflow guard (cleared on EventSessionIdle), the COMPACT line per the current tool's writer (messages-only + the ` emergency` suffix), and the spec-2+11 post-compaction directive via promptAsync (the retry vehicle — the hook returns void, so the old `{handled, action:"retry"}` return is gone). Smoke re-pinned 15/15, probe S11 re-pinned (11 checks: 76-81 + 257-261) — probe 257/257, gate green (commit hash recorded in the planner's follow-up bookkeeping commit — no self-reference). REMAINING (maintainer domain, verbatim): (1) the host restart (plugin activation), (2) the live overflow acceptance on a driven/forked session as the 2026-09-23 fork test (expect: ONE COMPACT line + the budget increment + the session survives/continues — the flag is already `true` in the budget file, no flag work needed). FOLLOW-UP (out of scope): the context_recovery + compact_memory ONE-plugin integration is the next candidate. Architecture ruling: host auto-compaction stays DEACTIVATED by design (`"auto": false` — it fired uncontrollably, `buffer` never worked); the host `compaction` config only supplies defaults (model + keep); the agent-driven compaction stays primary; the emergency compact is the remaining piece. Keep-values (CLARIFIED 2026-09-24 — no drift, by design): our plugins (compact_memory + the emergency backstop) read `compact_budget.json` (keepMessages 12); the host MANUAL compact (usable on any session any time, independent of `auto`) reads the opencode.json `compaction` block (keep.messages 18) — each system its own store; tokens agree (30000).

## #83. (closed 2026-09-27, direct session ses_f20d1b39… — his autoCompact question answered: the `autoCompact`/`saturationThreshold`/`outputReserve` keys currently gate ONLY the passive nudge suffix (auto_resume.ts onToolAfterNudge — no promptAsync, no compaction dispatch); raising the threshold would only push the nudge back; the ACTUAL auto-compaction backstop = context_recovery, live-verified by his overflow tests (the #93 close above, same evidence); the threshold knob stays in compact_budget.json (= 0.85, the nudge position)) — unit-2 backstop: catch the ACTUAL context-limit hit cleanly (revive context_recovery.ts)

- **Problem + evidence:** the pre-emptive trigger (now configurable, default
  0.95 via the #82-adjacent change) still fires BEFORE the limit, so a
  chunk of the window is never used. He wants to "use as much of the
  context window as possible" → move the threshold toward ~0.98 and rely
  on a CLEAN catch of the real limit hit. That mechanism ALREADY EXISTS
  (verified 2026-09-22): `.opencode/plugin/deactivated/context_recovery.ts`
  (324 lines, T5 approved design 2026-09-11, built on the maintainer's
  prototype) — a hook firing on the overflow `session.error` (activation
  flag `emergencyRecovery: true` in opencode.jsonc, read per fire; only
  `true` enables it), which compacts with an informed keep (30k tokens /
  12 messages), appends its COMPACT line to ctx.log, injects the
  re-application directive, and returns `{handled:true, action:"retry"}` —
  a SINGLE clean retry that replaces the slow "opencode removes the tail
  (last message in generation) and retries 5-6 times" loop. Over budget →
  CLEAN FAIL (returns unhandled, the error propagates). Budget: the SAME
  `compact_budget.json`, ≤2 per session id (self + emergency combined).
  A smoke test exists: `tests/context_recovery.smoke.mjs`. It is
  currently DEACTIVATED.
- **Desired outcome:** the pre-emptive threshold can be raised toward ~0.98
  (configurable) because the actual limit hit is caught cleanly (one
  compact + single retry) instead of the slow tail-removal loop; and an
  over-budget session gets a clean STOP (no runaway retries).
- **Acceptance criteria:** `emergencyRecovery: true` activates it; on an
  overflow `session.error` it compacts + returns a single retry (not 5-6
  tail loops); over budget → clean fail (error propagates; the -WARNING is
  the looprunner's/protocol's job); the shared ≤2/session budget is
  respected (re-read-then-write, no await between); smoke green.
- **Suggested scope:** re-activate + adapt
  `.opencode/plugin/deactivated/context_recovery.ts` to the CURRENT
  compact_memory summarize path (v1-generation client, config-resolved
  summarizer); wire the `emergencyRecovery` flag. KEY UNCERTAINTY: the
  host must actually CALL this hook on overflow — needs a LIVE
  verification (the prototype was working at build time, but the build
  changed since). Effort MEDIUM (the code exists but predates the current
  compact_memory design and is deactivated).
- **Status:** the paired configurable-threshold change LANDED
  (2026-09-22, worker: `saturationThreshold` (0 < t < 1, default 0.95) +
  `outputReserve` (>= 0, default 20_000) as per-tick fail-open keys in the
  budget file; smoke 89/89 + full gate green; commit hash recorded in the
   planner's follow-up bookkeeping). The BACKSTOP part remains open —
   maintainer call (needs his flag in the live opencode.jsonc + the live
   host-call verification). This is the enabler for raising the threshold
   to ~0.98. NOTE (2026-09-22, #84): the `emergencyRecovery` flag now lives
   in the shared compact_budget.json (not opencode.jsonc) — the live-flag
   part of this entry must be set there.

## #74. (closed 2026-09-27, direct session ses_f20d1b39… — maintainer: the backend no longer runs on ik_llama and the offending PR was reverted in the fork — non-issue, can be closed) — Write tool fails on long content payloads on this host

**Problem / evidence:** JSON parse errors ("Text: {." / "Expected '}'"), once even on a 3-line file — logged by four worker sessions (2026-09-19 long multi-paragraph args; 2026-09-20 Deep-Dive B run #4; 2026-09-21 run #6 "write failed for every payload"; 2026-09-21 run #7_1 three long-content failures). His --info note pointed at the fuzzy_numword intercept path-resolution — CORRECTED same day by him: the intercept is actually live, and two extra test rounds (his handover-file overwrite runs, direct-message specs writing other files) show the write still failing WITH the intercept deactivated; no opencode changes made; the problem predates the new model set (surfaced in Deep-Dive B run 2 with the old models) — so the intercept is NOT the root cause and this is a host-side issue independent of our models; 2026-09-21 (planner direct session): the SAME signature ("JSON parsing failed: Text: {.") hit a GREP tool call — scope extends beyond write; machine check: both error strings are embedded in the installed `opencode.exe` (v1.18.31: "JSON parsing failed: Text" x8, "Invalid input for tool" x2) → the failing parse is inside the opencode server, upstream of every plugin hook (intercept is log-only and sees already-parsed args); candidate captures: provider-side raw response log (maintainer) + `opencode --log-level DEBUG --print-logs` stderr capture (agent-side, flags verified); HIS HYPOTHESIS (2026-09-21, direct): the truncation began after his llama.cpp update — his bit-drift-countermeasure fork `ik_llama` — and OTHER PEOPLE report the same issue → suspected fork-side (provider) bug; isolation test = direct-to-server long-JSON probe bypassing opencode; SECOND LIVE DATA POINT same session: a webfetch call with SHORT args failed with the identical signature → the signature is "assistant response stream cut mid tool-call JSON", long payload is a risk factor, not the sole cause; fork identified as `ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp` (issue #380 "Drop at the start of generation" confirms known fork-side streaming bugs); ROOT-CAUSE CANDIDATE (his link 2026-09-21): issue #2492 "Truncated tool calls on qwen3.8-flash-next" (opened 2026-09-20, open) — regression attributed to PR #2470; its raw SSE dump shows the tool-call arguments JSON closed MID-VALUE (finish_reason=tool_calls on an incomplete JSON) = exactly our signature; his timeline caveat: PR ~18h old vs his problem ~48h old → "might be not connected"; BISECTION POINT (this session): 4 live failures pre-reload (grep, webfetch, two writes — incl. the short-arg webfetch — all served under the buggy build); after his unload + fresh reload to the old ik_llama: 2 short writes clean + byte-verified (scratchpad flaky_t1/t2.txt); CONSTRAINT (his): agents never send direct requests to the inference server — single slot unloads the session's model (also logged in knowledge_tools.md single-slot section). POST-RELOAD RESULTS (old ik_llama, same session — natural A/B against the 4 pre-reload failures): 70B write clean, 156B write clean, 10,095B write clean (101 lines, tail-verified — far past the 4k acceptance bar; caveat: repetitive filler content — a non-repetitive variant + cross-model coverage remain). NEXT: optional — one non-repetitive ~10k write + one run on another model, then the entry can move toward close pending the fork's #2470 fix.
**Outcome:** host-side fix (maintainer domain); if not fixed, codify the workaround (create via bash printf/heredoc, then small write/edit append batches — see knowledge_tools.md) in the repo docs so runs don't re-discover it.
**Acceptance:** a ~4k+ char write payload succeeds without parse errors (tested across models), OR the workaround is documented and the next long-file run completes with no write-tool failure.
**Suggested scope:** opencode host (maintainer) + repo docs/prompts (agent-side).
**Status:** open; root cause CONFIRMED per timeline (his 2026-09-21: PR #2470 merged ~4 days ago ≈ his ~48h onset; #2492 = same signature) — old ik_llama in place, workaround stays until the fork patches #2470; his update discipline: never adopt a fresh ik_llama build immediately — let it rest so others find the bugs first.

- **Problem / evidence:** plan2 wired ONLY `read` (+string filePath) — the
  core matcher (`resolveReadPath`, corpus cache) is corpus-root-agnostic and
  ready for more read-scope tools (research §2.3/§2.6).
- **Outcome:** extend the hook scope to `glob`/`grep` path args and add the
  section-anchor resolver (anchor line-prefix → offset, exactly-one-match,
  fail-closed on 0/≥2 — §2.6), fail-closed + both-outcomes logged, probe

  fuzzy-rejected d/gap lines, out-of-sandbox prefixes, per-session counts —
  counts move, the log grows live). Census-basis note (worker finding): the
  spec's "139 distinct session ids" was a substring census; the script's
  field-2 census reads 86 at 3130 lines — the field-2 census is the R4

## #70. (closed 2026-09-28, plan30 maintenance pass — all units LANDED + live-accepted: unit A 6864bc0 (2026-09-21) + unit B d4ef76e (2026-09-22); live acceptance 2026-09-21 (DUMP-OK PASS + config resolution; the cross model-read bug found+fixed 280b8d0 + re-accepted); the requested research-spec follow-on superseded by the #99/#101/#105 research tracks) — compact_memory rework: config-resolved summarizer + queued message + dump diagnostics (2026-09-16, new priority.md item; re-scoped 2026-09-21 by his priority.md #1)
- **Problem / evidence:** maintainer priority.md addition: context_limit
  error → compact the worker (use the Gemma compaction model per
  opencode.jsonc `agent.compaction`); the flow is SERIAL (compaction active
  = planner inactive — no sleep/wait polling); cross-compaction needs only
  the target session_id (providerID/modelID to be REMOVED from the
  compact_memory parameter list — resolved from opencode.jsonc; the
  parameter descriptions were "described badly" — #55 item). Plan2 hit the
  friction live: the dispatch resolved the SUMMARIZER to the same model as
  the target session (Qwen) and I had to wait for the single slot. HIS
  2026-09-21 priority.md #1 ADDITIONS: (1) BOTH providerID and modelID
  REMOVED from the exposed parameter list — the summarizer resolves from
  opencode.jsonc `agent.compaction.model` ("provider/model"); absent /
  malformed → the COMPACTING session's own model (his ruling: same-model
  compaction gives better results even if slower); the LIVE config has
  `agent.compaction` commented out → the fallback path is currently
  active; (2) the `message` arg does NOT arrive in the compacted session
  (it only rides the caller's tool result) — change to a direct QUEUED
  prompt message (promptAsync, no await — delivered on resume);
  (3) DUMP-FAIL evidence (ctx.log 2026-09-16/17: 2× `spawnSync node
  ETIMEDOUT`; measured: the dump script is 0.12 s standalone — a HUNG
  CHILD INSIDE THE HOST, not script slowness; the hook logs failures
  only, no DUMP-OK line → add DUMP-OK + duration for self-diagnosis;
  defensive spawn stdio pipe→ignore); (4) auto-compaction on context
  limit = an option togglable via a parameter in the budget file
  (`.opencode/temp/compact_budget.json`); (5) research spec requested: a
  small research on compact_memory + block_transfer (he wrote
  "buffer_transfer") — up/downs, what is problematic and why,
  alternatives.
- **Outcome (goal):** param rework landed (4-key schema:
  sessionID/keepTokens/keepMessages/message; config resolution with
  session-model fallback) + the message queued to the compacted session +
  DUMP-OK diagnostics + (follow-on) the budget-file auto-compact toggle +
  (follow-on) the requested research spec; probe/smoke green; live
  acceptance after a host restart.
- **Acceptance:** param rework landed + probe/smoke green; a cross-compact
  dispatch needs only the session_id; the queued message reaches the
  compacted session (live, post-restart); the toggle readable from the
  budget file (follow-on unit); the research spec filed + run (follow-on
  unit).

  **Live acceptance ATTEMPTED (2026-09-21, plan6, post-restart, planner-run):**

  dispatch (ctx.log `DUMP-OK ses_f3b16aa46… 76` + `compaction_dumps/
  ses_f3b16aa46…_c0.md` created); (b) config resolution — the live
  `agent.compaction` is COMMENTED OUT (opencode.jsonc line ~130) → the
  same-model fallback is the active path (the dispatch reached it);
  (c) CROSS MODEL-READ LIVE BUG FOUND: two live cross dispatches failed
  `no resolvable model … request was NOT sent` + `cross-session model read
  empty (no messages)` for sessions that DO have messages — root cause
  measured: the in-process client resolves SDK calls to a RequestResult
  wrapper `{ data: [...] }`, never a bare array (precedent: auto_resume.ts
  383-386 unwraps `create()` as `res.data.id ?? res.id`; SDK types
  `SessionMessagesResponses = { 200: Array<{info, parts}> }`) —
  `resolveModel` ran `Array.isArray` on the raw result → always "no

## #78. (closed 2026-09-28, plan30 maintenance pass — LANDED 2026-09-23 (6b33907, per his 2026-09-23 ruling "go for 1 + 2, plus 3+4 unified": --json raw mode + lossless full markdown + --lite preset + hook 120 s budget / pipe stderr / one retry; planner-verified: --json spot-check 70 msgs / 337 parts exact-match the live DB)) — Dump completeness: the session dumps filter out parts (thinking/writing) (2026-09-21, planner; his --info note in priority.md)
- **Problem / evidence:** his --info (priority.md, 2026-09-21): "automatic
  dumps which were generated by the dumping script to backup all sessions
  seemed to not include any thinking, writing or other parts at all" (e.g.
  `.opencode/archive/sessions/ses_f5aefe9e1ffemgTiq9GELiqaGL.md`); "the
  current dumping in the compact tool seems to filter out some parts. if
  they are in json maybe it is best to just dump this directly as it is to
  preserve the structure"; dumps in general should be COMPLETE — filtering
  out tool calls can be done by scripts on a need basis.
- **Desired outcome:** dumps (the `dump_session.cjs` corpus dumps AND the
  compact pre-dump hook) preserve ALL part types (incl. reasoning); a raw
  JSON dump mode that preserves structure as-is; the markdown filtering
  stays available as an on-demand script concern.
- **Acceptance:** a dump of a session containing reasoning parts shows
  them (or the explicit JSON mode exists); his ruling recorded
  (markdown-completeness vs raw-JSON-as-is as the default).
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/agent/scripts/db/dump_session.cjs` (+ the
  `preCompactionDump` call site in compact_memory.ts),
  `.opencode/archive/sessions/` (read-only reference).
- **Live evidence #2 (plan6, 2026-09-21):** the compact pre-dump hook
  ALSO times out on large sessions — `DUMP-FAIL ses_f3a51aedcffeSa0cwt8PmwlXAr
  spawnSync node ETIMEDOUT` (ctx.log) on a ~90 % session while a small
  session dumped in 76 ms (`DUMP-OK`) — the dump's spawn timeout does not
  scale with session size (same script family as the corpus dumps).

   (plan11, explore ses_f317d80c2ffeMGup4T9z5IvUs2 — findings:
   `.opencode/loop/autorun-2026-09-21_15-33/plan11_78_scope.md`. Headline: his
  cited corpus file is a STALE 2026-09-15 slim backfill — the CURRENT full
  mode emits all 141 parts of that session (30 reasoning + 16 text verbatim);
  residual gaps = tool `state.input`/`state.output` never emitted + 400/600-
  char caps on other types; NO raw-JSON mode exists. Hook timeout = fixed
  60 s (`compact_memory.ts` L359) vs measured 64–87 ms dump wall-times → the
  live DUMP-FAIL ETIMEDOUT is a SPAWN-LEVEL STALL, not budget exhaustion
  (`stdio: "ignore"` hides the child stderr). Ranked recs: (1) add a
  `--json` raw-as-is mode to `dump_session.cjs` (S; hook-default = his call),
  (2) raise/diagnose the hook timeout (S–M), (3) make markdown full mode
  lossless (S) + (4) later an on-demand markdown filter over the raw JSON.)

Spec written (handover_task.md) + `worker_Q3S_170K` launched; the pre-compaction hook keeps its markdown backup rendered with the lossless full mode (raw JSON stays the on-demand `--json` mode — planner call, veto-able).

## #97. (closed 2026-09-28, plan30 maintenance pass — LANDED 2026-09-25 (worker-17: 07bdd56 Unit 1 redirect + 0d9b8e6 Unit 2 escape return-info + 6684991 handover; gate green) + LIVE-ACCEPTED 2026-09-26 (plan22 planner spot-check: the Windows-root form redirected 1:1 into the scratchpad, kind=redirect line delivered)) — R8 sandbox redirect: out-of-sandbox path args redirected INTO the sandbox (2026-09-25, his live priority.md edit labeled "TODO #97"; planner-14 filed)
- **Problem / evidence:** his priority.md live section 2026-09-25 ("# fuzzy_numword
  R8"): repeated accesses outside the sandbox stop everything until he
  intervenes — e.g. an access to `C:\Users\Wasiejen\AppData\Local\Temp`
  instead of the designated `C:\Users\Wasiejen\AppData\Local\Temp\opencode`;
  the earlier priority.md fuzzy_numword item gives the shape (redirect
  calls like `C:\Users\Asiejen\AppData\Local\Temp\opencode\brtest.mjs`
  into the sandbox). His named basis for the allowed paths: the
  `permission.external_directory` + `references` sections of
  opencode.jsonc (both). This is #95 sub-item (4) first half — the
  escape return-info is the second half (rides the same launch).
- **Desired outcome:** an out-of-sandbox path argument that maps 1:1 into
  a sandbox/allowed path is REDIRECTED (mutated) by the intercept before
  the call runs, with the mandatory log line (kind + orig= + value= per
  his return-info ruling) — the "repeated accesses stop everything"
  loop ends; NO new out-of-sandbox access is ever granted (redirect
  only, never an allow-widening).
- **Acceptance:** a controlled out-of-sandbox path (the Temp-without-
  opencode-suffix case) is redirected + logged; a path with no 1:1
  mapping fails closed (no mutation); probe pins per the established
  pattern; standard gate green.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/intercept_observer.ts` (+ core —
  the allowed-path resolution from opencode.jsonc
  `permission.external_directory` + `references`),
  `.opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs`, the tests.
- **Status:** LANDED (worker-17, 2026-09-25 — commits `07bdd56` (Unit 1
  R8 redirect) + `0d9b8e6` (Unit 2 escape return-info) + `6684991`
  (handover); planner-17 spot-verified: intercept smoke re-run 67/67
  green, probe 303/303, pytest 459 passed + 1 warning, ruff F=0 per the
  handover). The return-info/feedback half landed as Unit 2 (his
  context-saving ruling honored: truncated first form in the feedback,
  full pre-mutation payload in the journal `pre-escape` field).
   Sign-offs (handover §deliberately-not-done): S28 probe section
   placement, `pair-resolved` verdict reuse (the 12-token vocabulary is
   pinned), the redirect note text, the 13b hint token — all accepted by
   planner-17. **LIVE-ACCEPTED 2026-09-26 (plan22, planner spot-check):**
   the Windows-root form `C:\Users\Wasiejen\AppData\Local\Temp\
   plan22_r8.txt` redirected 1:1 into the scratchpad (the `kind=redirect`
   line delivered in the tool feedback — the R8 note mechanism live).

## #107. (open, 2026-09-28, plan28 feedback review; pre-approved class) DUMP-OK / COMPACT ctx.log lines should carry the FULL repo-relative directory
- **Problem / evidence:** agent_feedback 2026-09-27_16-20 (planner): the
  #92 live-acceptance verification cost two extra probes — the ctx.log
  DUMP-OK line carries only the archive-RELATIVE path
  (`compaction_dumps/…_c0.md`) but the real dir is
  `.opencode/archive/sessions/compaction_dumps/`; the TODO/summary now names
  the full dir, but the log line itself still forces the re-discovery.
- **Desired outcome:** the DUMP-OK / DUMP-FAIL / DUMP-RETRY lines (and the
  COMPACT line where a file path is named) carry the full repo-relative
  path — a live acceptance is a single `ls`.
- **Acceptance criteria:** the line format change pinned (probe S14
  byte-exact pins + compact_memory smoke re-pins); gate green.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/compact_memory.ts` (the dump-hook
  log lines), `.opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs` (S14),
  `.opencode/plugin/tests/compact_memory.smoke.mjs`.
- **Status:** LANDED (plan29, 2026-09-28, planner-29 planner-direct —
  pre-approved class): the three DUMP-* lines (DUMP-OK / DUMP-RETRY= /
  DUMP-FAIL) now carry the FULL repo-relative dump path
  (`.opencode/archive/sessions/` + name — the `DUMP_ARCHIVE_REL` constant
  shared with the archive-dir join) so a live acceptance is a single `ls`;
  the spawn's `--out` keeps the corpus-relative name (the script's
  OUT_DIR-relative arg); the COMPACT line names no file path (checked —
  unchanged). Pins re-pinned: probe S14 check 104 (4 includes()) + S25
  check 255 (regex + label) + the compact_memory smoke's two DUMP-OK pins
  (md + json). Measured: compact_memory smoke 78/78; probe all green
  except the 11 pre-existing python312 environmental failures (see #113).
  Hash in the plan29 bookkeeping commit.

## #108. (open, 2026-09-28, plan28 feedback review; pre-approved class) auto_resume smoke: programmatic pair-block fixture builder
- **Problem / evidence:** agent_feedback 2026-09-27_20-49 (planner): hand-
  re-typing the 10-pair `#96 (c)` trim-restore fixture was error-prone — 19
  lines written for 10 pairs (one `route=` line dropped), caught by the
  smoke only after 2 runs + a standalone repro.
- **Desired outcome:** the multi-pair fixture blocks are generated
  programmatically (a loop building the string, not literal lines) + a
  pair-count assert so a dropped line fails instantly with the count.
- **Acceptance criteria:** the #96 (c) fixture (and any sibling multi-pair
  fixtures) built by the generator; a pair-count assert present; the smoke
  re-runs green with identical pin coverage.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/tests/auto_resume.smoke.mjs` (the
  #96 (c) fixture block + the generator helper).
- **Status:** LANDED (plan29, 2026-09-28, planner-29 planner-direct —
  pre-approved class): the #96 (c) trim-restore fixture's 10 pairs are now
  generated PROGRAMMATICALLY in the child script (`L(i) = charCode 97+i` +
  `Array.from({length: 10})` loop — the same pattern the cap-config
  sibling already carried) + a PAIR-COUNT assert (`pairCount !== 10` →
  `console.log("PAIR_COUNT " + pairCount)` + non-zero exit BEFORE the log
  is seeded — a dropped pair fails instantly with the count in the smoke
  detail). The sibling multi-pair fixture (cap-config child) was already
  programmatic (checked — no other hand-typed pair blocks exist).
  Measured: auto_resume smoke 140/140 (the 140 = 139 baseline + the
  3914181 cap-config check — the NAP baseline was stale, corrected in
  plan29 bookkeeping). Hash in the plan29 bookkeeping commit.

## #110. (open, 2026-09-28, plan28 ideas.md scan; pre-approved — docs) per-plugin README files for `.opencode/plugin/`
- **Problem / evidence:** ideas.md 2026-09-22_17-53 (maintainer): "might be
  a good idea to create separate README.md files for each plugin we have
  written — general explanation what it does and how it is implemented;
  might contain gotchas encountered — lessons learned and what not to do
  with reasoning; this might be better in another gotchas file specific to
  plugins."
- **Desired outcome:** one README per our plugin (auto_resume,
  compact_memory, context_recovery, intercept_observer, gauge/ctx nudge
  family, block_transfer/loop_log/submit tool plugins where they live in
  the plugin dir) — what it does, how it is implemented (hook surface +
  key files), the gotchas/lessons (from knowledge entries + session
  incidents); each ≤ ~60 lines, pointer-only (no restatement of the
  knowledge base).
- **Acceptance criteria:** the READMEs present in the plugin folder; every
  plugin in `.opencode/plugin/` covered; content spot-checked against the
  code (no stale hook names); the folder README (if any) indexes them.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/` (new README files, one per
  plugin), `.opencode/agent/knowledge/knowledge_plugins.md` (source of the
  gotchas).
- **Status:** LANDED (plan32 unit 1, 2026-09-28, worker-32 — 9 per-plugin /
  per-tool READMEs next to their sources + the two folder-README index
  lines; the tools folder's 4 READMEs ride the same batch — see the
  worker-32 handover). Hash recorded in the planner's follow-up bookkeeping
  commit.

## #111. (open, 2026-09-28, plan28 feedback review; pre-approved — small doc/prompt batch) doc/prompt friction batch from the plan28 review
- **Problem / evidence:** three small pre-approved doc items from the
  feedback review that are NOT in the prompt/spec docs yet: (1)
  ideas.md 2026-09-22_12-03 — the worker "burned 10k tokens and 6.5 minutes
  to decide to look up how others" referenced the git hash in his closing
  commit (happens nearly every time); the task-spec doc carries the
  commit-hash DoD RULE (codified 2026-09-22) but the worker prompt has no
  short working example of the closing-commit message form (what goes in,
  what the hash line says — "hash recorded in the planner's follow-up
  bookkeeping"); (2) agent_feedback 2026-09-27_15-55 — a probe-comment
  syntax slip survived to the ~2-min gate run: a cheap `node --check
  .opencode/plugin/probes/handover_probe.mjs` after each probe edit batch
  would catch token slips early; (3) agent_feedback 2026-09-26_15-13 — the
  intercept smoke's module-state flip (the second factory call re-points
  module state to proj2) is easy to miss on a fresh read: a header-level
  note in the smoke file naming the before2/read2 convention for sections
  after the R8 config-read block (~L712).
- **Desired outcome:** the three one-liner doc fixes in place (worker
  prompt commit-message example; `node --check` line in the test-gate doc;
  smoke header convention note).
- **Acceptance criteria:** the three lines present (worker prompt,
  `repo_testgate.md` or the worker prompt, the intercept smoke header);
  no behavior change.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/agent/prompts/agents/prompt_agent_task.md`,
  `.opencode/agent/readme/repo_testgate.md`,
  `.opencode/plugin/tests/intercept_observer.smoke.mjs` (header comment only).
- **Status:** LANDED (plan29, 2026-09-28, planner-29 planner-direct —
  pre-approved, no behavior change): (1) worker prompt `Checkpoint &
  handoff` gains the commit-message worked example (subject + ~3 body
  lines; the hash NEVER in the commit — `LANDED` (hash recorded in the
  planner's follow-up bookkeeping commit), the spec doc's hash DoD rule);
  (2) `repo_testgate.md` Test conventions gains the `node --check`
  probe-syntax line (run before the gate after each probe edit batch);
  (3) the intercept smoke header gains the MODULE-STATE FLIP note
  ((12f) second factory re-points the shared module state to proj2 —
  from (12f) on only `before2`/`read2` may be used). Hash in the plan29
  bookkeeping commit.

## #112. (open, 2026-09-28, plan28 ideas.md scan; pre-approved — docs) auto-resume explainer for the compaction handout + knowledge (compact, unit-by-unit)
- **Problem / evidence:** ideas.md 2026-09-24_21-13 (maintainer): "include
  infos about auto-resume in the compaction handout and system prompt —
  e.g. what unit 2 and 4 actually do, how the restart of the planner after
  compaction works, how a new planner is started; move it to knowledge
  folder together." The knowledge base has the deep-dives (vendored
  upstream reference) + our unit surface reports, but NO single compact
  "what our auto_resume plugin does, unit by unit, in 1 page" explainer —
  the compaction handout (the maintainer's draft) carries none of it.
- **Desired outcome:** one compact knowledge entry (≤ ~80 lines) — unit 1
  (skeleton/logging), unit 2 (context-limit nudge — the passive ctx-line
  suffix, what the threshold gates), unit 3 (new-planner spawn helper),
  unit 4 (liveness watchdog — the restart→spawn branch + the recovery
  continue + the lineage cap + deactivation) — each: what it does, what
  triggers it, the log lines it emits; pointer-only to the deep-dives /
  surface reports for detail. The handout inclusion itself is the
  maintainer's paste (his draft file).
- **Acceptance criteria:** the knowledge entry present (dated, pointer-
  only); the unit descriptions spot-checked against auto_resume.ts (no
  stale hook names); the handout inclusion noted in the summary as
  maintainer-pending.
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/agent/knowledge/knowledge_plugins.md` or
  a new dated file in `opencode-plugins/`, `.opencode/plugin/auto_resume.ts`
  (read-only reference).
- **Status:** LANDED (plan32 unit 1, 2026-09-28, worker-32 — the dated
  explainer `knowledge/opencode-plugins/2026-09-28_auto-resume-units-
  explainer.md`, ≤80 lines, spot-checked against auto_resume.ts). The
  compaction-handout paste stays maintainer-domain. Hash recorded in the
  planner's follow-up bookkeeping commit.

## #114. (closed 2026-09-29, first fresh session in the new workspace root ses_f130ae200ffeDRuhAMKmw0N1qE — the final no-total data point; filed 2026-09-28, plan30 maintenance pass — feedback review; pre-approved class — truthfulness) the injected ctx: line's budget suffix disagrees with the ctx_gauge self-read (1 vs 5 compactions left — same session, no compaction in between)
- **Problem / evidence:** agent_feedback 2026-09-28_02-40 (planner-29): at
  session start the injected `ctx:` line read
  `SESSION=ses_f1a8a9671ffezAA9MrZmlE8YKV CTX=notAvailable | 1 compactions
  left` while the `ctx_gauge` self-read (source of truth per #103) showed
  `5 compactions left` minutes later — no compaction in between, same
  session. The two code paths (the injected nudge's budget read vs the gauge
  tool's budget read) resolve the per-session budget differently; the
  injected line even emitted the budget suffix while its own ctx read was
  `notAvailable` (the budget read ran independently of the ctx read).
- **Desired outcome:** one budget value for both surfaces — the injected line
  and the ctx_gauge tool agree; the root cause of the divergence identified
  (which file/field each path reads, why they differed).
- **Acceptance:** a next session's injected line + self-gauge show the same
  "N compactions left" (measured); the root cause recorded in the knowledge
  base (dated entry).
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/plugin/` (the gauge/ctx-nudge plugin that
  emits the injected line + the ctx_gauge tool/gauge core),
  `.opencode/temp/compact_budget.json` (the store both read), the knowledge
  base (dated note).
- **Status:** LANDED (2026-09-28, plan31, worker-31 — hash recorded in the
  planner's follow-up bookkeeping commit).
- **Status note (2026-09-28, plan31, planner-31): ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
  (planner-measured — knowledge_plugins.md entry "Gauge budget suffix:
  no-total reads…"): a gauge read with no finished step yet (a fresh session
  at session start) resolves the model to "" (the model comes only from the
  finished-step row) → model_budget.default (=1) instead of the session's
  real cap (5) — the session row's own model column is never read. 3rd live
  data point (this session: injected "1 compaction left" vs ctx_gauge self-
  read "5 compactions left", same session, no compaction between). FIX
  DELEGATED (worker spec plan31_ho_task.md — session-row model as the
   no-total fallback; pins re-pinned to exercise the new behavior + keep the
   default-1 fallback pin).**
- **Live check 2026-09-28 (plan32, 4th data point):** a fresh session
  (ses_f19fdb571ffeb0aoqGGu62wbzo) carried the injected `ctx:` line
  "1 compactions left" while its ctx_gauge self-read showed "5
  compactions left" — the live host process still PREDATES the fix
  fea1cbb; live acceptance remains pending the maintainer's host restart
  (a fresh session's injected line should then read "5 compactions
  left").
- **LIVE-ACCEPTED (2026-09-29, direct ses_f15c490bdffe9KsxVC3kDdLi1K,
  post-restart):** the injected ctx line and the ctx_gauge self-read
  both read "5 compactions left" for the same session (`123085 (72%)
  REM=46915 | 5`) — the original 1-vs-5 mismatch is GONE on the live
  build (budget store restored by the maintainer). Residual: the exact
  no-total failure path (a FRESH session's first injected line) gets
  its final check on the next fresh session's first ctx line (should
  read 5, not 1) — close on that data point.

- **Final check 2026-09-29 (first fresh session in the new workspace
   root, ses_f130ae200ffeDRuhAMKmw0N1qE — CLOSING the entry):** the fresh
   session's first injected ctx line read `SESSION=ses_f130ae200ffeDRuhAMKmw0N1qE
   CTX=notAvailable | 5 compactions left` — the no-total path emitted the
   session's real cap (5), not the default 1. Both surfaces agree; root
   cause + fix history in the bullets above (knowledge entry in
   knowledge_plugins.md). CLOSED.

## #126. (open, 2026-09-30, direct session ses_f0e129deeffeqmM5rc8mpnTY2Q — live acceptance run of #120U1 after the maintainer's restart; pre-approved class — agent-usage tool fix) context_trim's in-process-only sqlite backend fails in the live host process (no spawn fallback)
- **Problem / evidence:** the first live `report` call (2026-09-30 ~15:55; the
  live process is the current build — `context_trim` IS in the live toolset,
  registration confirmed) returned `db-error: no in-process writable sqlite
  backend (bun:sqlite / node:sqlite both unavailable)`. The header design
  (`context_trim.ts` L72-79) deliberately has no spawn fallback (a "no blind
  CLI write" rule). The gauge core proves the third backend works in this
  live host: `spawn-sqlite3` via `.opencode/plugin/tools/sqlite3.exe`
  (`gauge.mjs` `DEFAULT_BACKENDS` L163, `DEFAULT_EXE_PATH` L161, the
  "PROVEN IN PRODUCTION" comment L42-44) — all live gauge reads use it.
- **Desired outcome:** `context_trim` works in the live host process
  (`report` AND `tail`), staying fail-closed when NO backend is available at
  all (no blind write).
- **Acceptance:** the existing 20/20 fixture pins stay green; 2-3 new pins
  forcing the spawn-sqlite3-only backend (report content parity with the
  in-process path on the fixture DB; a tail rewrite lands in the fixture DB;
  at least one validation rejection still fires via the spawn path); the
  standard gate green (probe 352/352 + all 11 smokes); live re-acceptance =
  the maintainer's NEXT restart (the live process lags HEAD — the planner
  runs `report` on a real session; `tail`'s live test stays the maintainer's
  throwaway-session call).
- **Suggested scope:** `.opencode/tools/context_trim.ts` (`openDb` L98-129 +
  a backend-list test hook), `.opencode/plugin/tests/context_trim.smoke.mjs`;
  reference (read-only): `.opencode/plugin/scripts/gauge.mjs` (the
  spawn-sqlite3 cascade region).
- **Status:** LANDED 2026-09-30 (worker session ses_f0d49cb6bffeNMhGpmF7O3DyjU,
  code+smoke commit `a43311a`): `openDb` chain bun→node→spawn-sqlite3 (the
  gauge core's execFileSync discipline; the tail transaction = ONE CLI
  invocation `PRAGMA busy_timeout; BEGIN; UPDATE; COMMIT;`) + the
  `setBackends` test hook; report/tail logic unchanged; fail-closed end
  kept. Standard gate green: probe 352/352 + all 11 smokes (context_trim
  25/25 — the 20 old pins + 5 forced spawn-only pins on a second fixture
  session). LIVE-ACCEPTED (`report`) 2026-09-30 post-restart — the planner
  ran a live `report` on a real session (ses_f0e129deeffeqmM5rc8mpnTY2Q):
  a valid window map via the spawn-sqlite3 fallback, no db-error (code unit
  a43311a). LIVE DEBUG (2026-09-30/10-01, the forked test session): two
  further live-only failures found and fixed in the planner's direct
  session — (1) the TAB separator arg is whitespace-collapsed in the
  Bun-compiled live host's Windows command-line join → CLI arg shift →
  interactive mode → the deterministic 2500 ms kill (the gauge's
  separator-less call worked live — same exe, same ro-URI; fixed:
  `\x01` SOH separator, live-verified post-fix: the fork report reached
  the big query and produced output); (2) the 1 MB SPAWN_MAX_BUFFER was
  too small — the report pulls the window's part JSON through the CLI
  (measured: fork 1271 KB, main 921 KB of parts) → ENOBUFS (fixed:
  16 MB + a >1 MB smoke pin + stderr on the timeout error; smoke
  26/26). 16 MB build loaded on the maintainer's 2026-10-01 restart:
  **`report` LIVE-ACCEPTED** (valid window map: marker + retained=31 +
  post-summary=51 on the fork).   `tail` live WRITE was blocked by a
  live-process-specific RW hang — MECHANISM FOUND: the tail SQL
  inlined a JSON.stringify literal (double quotes); Bun's Windows
  command-line join mangles double-quote-bearing argv (same family as
  the TAB collapse) → the CLI loses its SQL arg → interactive mode →
  the deterministic 2500 ms kill (the report's single-quote-only SQL
  works live; the identical call 19 ms from bash with correct quoting;
  the 81 MB stale WAL ruled out; the fork's DB layer checked —
  bun:sqlite static import works there, semaphore-scoped short
  executes, no transaction across tool execution, so the earlier
  deadlock candidate is withdrawn). FIX LANDED (2026-10-01): the
  single-field edit now happens INSIDE sqlite via json_set (JSON1,
  bundled CLI 3.53.4 verified) — only the new tail_start_id binds, the
  SQL text carries no double quotes; smoke 26/26 (byte-exact JSON
  output via both the in-process and the spawn path). **tail LIVE-
  ACCEPTED** (2026-10-01, json_set build): the rewrite returned
  `tail= msg_0f46d581… -> msg_0f46d58e… keep=6`; DB readback confirms
  the part row carries the new tail_start_id (JSON byte-exact); the
  host re-derived the shrunken window — context 204k → ~169k (the
  lever; the maintainer's prediction confirmed). Floor-6 refusal:
  smoke-verified byte-exact; the live attempts were blocked by a NEW
  post-tail hang mode (report + floor-tail 2500 ms-killed after the
  successful tail, while the identical report worked live before it —
  trigger unknown; candidates: a checkpoint window under the host's
  streaming writes / an AV rescan of the just-modified DB — noted,
  not chased at the stop line).   Unit 2 UNHELD (its hold was the tail
  live test). POST-TAIL HANG RESOLVED (2026-10-01, same session): the
  pattern across all restarts was FIRST spawned CLI call per process
  succeeds, every later one 2500 ms-kills (the maintainer's "first
  call poisons the following" guess, confirmed: bash/node parents and
  the gauge's async execFile keep working — the gauge's ctx lines
  never failed). Cause: the live Bun host's execFileSync spawns only
  once per process (compiled-Bun Windows stdio-handle issue). Fix:
  the spawn path now uses the ASYNC execFile — the gauge's proven
  pattern (gauge.mjs readSpawnSqlite3) — smoke 26/26. LIVE-RE-VERIFIED
  (2026-10-01, after the restart): THREE in-process spawn calls in
  one process, all green — report ✓, report again ✓ (pre-fix: every
  call after the first 2500 ms-killed), floor-6 refusal

  #120 U1 context_trim FULLY LIVE-ACCEPTED (report + tail rewrite +
  floor refusal, live + smoke). The residual fork question (dynamic
  bun:sqlite/node:sqlite imports fail in the live tool context while
  the host's static import works) stays in the todo-inbox finding.
  (The final hash rides the planner's follow-up bookkeeping commit.)
## 72. Write-scope residual hazard: new-file near-miss (maintainer decision; 2026-09-17)
- **Problem / evidence:** the write-fuzzy channel (and the pair gate) cannot
  distinguish "a mistyped path to an EXISTING file" from "a deliberately
  NEW filename that happens to sit within d<=1 of an existing sibling" —
  a legitimate new-file write (e.g. creating `file-5.txt` next to
  `file-4.txt`) can be mutated onto the sibling and overwrite it. Read
  scope has no such hazard (non-destructive). Pinned as behavior: S20
  checks 200/201 + smoke 8f (worker R2, commit 35f8143).
- **Outcome (decision needed):** accept as designed (audit lines carry
  the ORIGINAL arg — re-targeting verifiable after the fact), OR mitigate
  later with an intent signal the interceptor does not currently have
  (e.g. agent confirms the log line before the write lands — R6-era
  surface).
- **Acceptance:** your ruling recorded; if mitigate: spec'd as a follow-on
  stage (R6-adjacent), not built before approval.
- **Status:** RULING 2026-09-17 (direct session): **M1 approved** — restrict
  the implicit write-fuzzy to `edit`/`block_transfer` (no new-file intent is
  legal there → redirect is unambiguous); `write` loses the implicit channel
  (new-file IS a legal intent → every degraded outcome becomes a visible
  stray file, never a silent overwrite); the pair channel stays unchanged
  (strict existence, fail-closed). **M1 LANDED (commit 9ec4c0b, 2026-09-17,
  worker):** dispatch guard in intercept_observer.ts (write excluded from the
  fuzzy channel); S20 re-pinned (196/198 no fuzzy line, 200/201 NOT mutated +
  zero lines) + new edit counter-pins 208/209; probe 208/208, smoke 36/36,
   pytest 459+1w, ruff F=0. **LIVE ACCEPTED 2026-09-17 (post-restart one-
   shot, scratchpad fixture, torn down):** the d=1 new-file write landed
   LITERAL (zero fuzzy lines — the guard live; the d=1 sibling untouched —
   the hazard is dead) AND the `edit` d=1 typo was still corrected
   (`fuzzy scope=write … d=1 gap=inf`, no stray file). Follow-on: R7
   (segment resolver) + R8 (root re-anchoring) STAGED + design agreed
   (substitution bar approved 09-17, decision-record §5); R9 documented-
   optional. See NAP 2026-09-17 direct session.
